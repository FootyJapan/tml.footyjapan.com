															<p><b>1. SCHEDULING:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>i) Where possible games will be scheduled up to 1-month in advance, these schedules (and any changes) will be available to captains on the TML fixtures page: <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/pages/fixtures.html">http://footyjapan.com/pages/fixtures.html</a></p>
																<p>ii) Captains are required to be aware of their teams' schedule at all times.</p>
																<p>iii) Teams will not be able to reschedule/cancel games within 14-days of the scheduled match. Offenders, in all cases, will be forfeited 1pt and a 3-0 win will be awarded to the opposition. Forfeiting teams will also be invoiced and required to pay the match fees for BOTH teams.</p>
																<p><b class="red"><a id="newrule1" name="newrule1"></a>iv) Captains must inform TML in as far advance as possible (before schedule goes up) of any weekend their team will not be available to play. &nbsp;Teams will have a maximum of 3 weekends per half season exclusively in which they are able to book off in advance. &nbsp;Therefore a total of 6 weekends across the entire season.</b></p>
																<p>v) Teams may not carry over any of their unused quota from the 1st half into the 2nd half</p>
																<p>vi) Booking off 1 day over a weekend constitutes 1 of the team&rsquo;s quota weekends.</p>
																<p>vii) 1st half = August 29/30 &#150; January 16/17 (excluding Dec 26/27 and Jan 2/3), &nbsp;2nd half = January 23/24th &#150; May 29/30th (excluding May 1/2)</p>
																<p><b class="red">viii) Once the schedule has been published on the TML website, teams will only have 2 chances across the entire season to refuse the fixture.</b></p>
																<p>ix) TML will endeavor to respond to requests regarding specific time slots, however, this cannot be guaranteed and should not be expected.</p>
																<p>x) In circumstances requiring last minute re-scheduling, cancellations and post-ponements by Footy Japan, the above restrictions will be alleviated in order to accommodate fixture commitments. &nbsp;This will be on a case-by-case basis.</p>
																<p>xi) Teams with non-native English speaking captains / team representatives <b>must </b>be able to communicate with TML/Footy Japan KK personnel with a <b>minimum of &lsquo;conversational&rsquo; English &#150; both spoken and written.</b></p>
															</ol>
															<p>&nbsp;<b>2. LEAGUE SYSTEM:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>&#x2022; AWARDING OF POINTS:</p>
																<ol>
																	<p>- 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss, -1 point (+3-0 loss) for a forfeit.</p>
																</ol>
																<p>&#x2022; LEAGUE RANKING:&nbsp;</p>
																<ol>
																	<p>- At the end of the season the league(s) will be decided by:  &nbsp;i) Total points,  ii) Goal difference, iii) Goals scored</p>
																</ol>
																<p>&#x2022; PROMOTION/RELEGATION</p>
																<ol>
																	<p>- Last two teams in Divisions 1 &amp; 2 will automatically be demoted for the start of Season 7. The top 2 teams in Divisions 2 &amp; 3 will be promoted likewise. Promotion to a higher division is not a choice; teams ending in first or second place in Divisions 2 or 3 at the end of Season 6 will be automatically promoted.</p>
																</ol>
															</ol>
															<p><b>3. MATCHES/GROUNDS:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>i) Each match will consist of 2-equal halves of 40-minutes, with a 5-10-minute break for half time.</p>
																<p>ii) Each team may use 11-players on the field and rotate a maximum of 5 substitutes during the game at the referees discretion.</p>
																<p>iii) Teams will arrive at the ground at least 30-minutes before the scheduled kick off time.</p>
																<p>iv) For a game to start, at least 7-registered players for any one team must line up* for the kick off no later than 5-minutes after the scheduled kick-off time. *Lining up means changed and READY TO PLAY. Any deviation from this rule will result in the forfeiting of 1-point and a 3-0 win will be awarded to the opposition. If this adversely affects promotion/relegation chances a head-to-head playoff will decide the outcome. Forfeiting teams will also be invoiced and required to pay the match fees for BOTH teams.</p>
															</ol>
															<p><b><i class="red">It is the duty of the referee to ensure that games start and finish on time and thus referees are empowered to start games EXACTLY 5-minutes after the scheduled kick-off time and reduce the halftime period as necessary to ensure games finish on time.</i></b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>v) The league will provide a referee for all matches but teams must supply one capable person to act as an impartial linesman and to be wearing attire that doesn't confuse any of the players or the referee. The linesman&rsquo;s decisions will be taken at the discretion of the referee. If a referee is unsatisfied with the ability of a linesman he may, at his discretion, replace the linesman or opt to use none.</p>
																<p>vi) Teams must wear matching numbered uniforms including socks and shorts and be aware of colour clashes with other teams by checking: (<a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/pages/teams.html">http://footyjapan.com/pages/teams.html</a>), or contacting TML personnel. In the event that a team only has one set of uniforms purchasing a set of bibs to permanently have on hand on match days would be advisable/sensible.<br>
																	<b class="red">Shin Pads are compulsory and players will not play without them.</b></p>
																<p>vii) Teams will completely clear up after themselves after matches including the field, the area surrounding it and ensure the changing rooms are left tidy (garbage and dirt free). Grounds with specific rules must be adhered to; failure to do so may result in expulsion from the league. (http://footyjapan.com/pages/fixtures.html)</p>
																<p>viii) Teams are expected to do their utmost to assist TML in securing decent grounds to play on, the teams who secure grounds to play on get priority use over them.</p>
															</ol>
															<p>&nbsp;<b>4. DISCIPLINE:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>&nbsp; - During matches, the referees will impose FIFA regulations. Red and yellow cards will be shown in accordance with these rules and be carried across both Tokyo Metropolis League and Footy Japan Cup competitions. In the case that a player is serving a ban and is playing for more than one team, the ban is to be served for the team the player was playing for when the offence leading to the ban occurred and<b> he can play for NO OTHER TEAM  until the ban is served</b>.</p>
																<p>&nbsp; - All bans will come into force immediately after the card is issued.</p>
																<p>&nbsp; - The following suspensions will be imposed for more serious offenses:</p>
																<ol>
																	<p>i) 2 yellow cards resulting in sending off = subsequent 1-match ban.</p>
																	<p>ii) 3 yellow cards = subsequent 1-match ban.</p>
																	<p>iii) 6 yellow cards will result in a 2-match ban.</p>
																	<p>iv) All red cards will result in a minimum 1-match ban. (2nd red card (of season) will result in a minimum 2 match ban, 3rd will be a minimum 4 match ban &amp; so on)</p>
																	<p>v) Punishment for physical violence towards other/own players will be determined by the advice of the TML Committee, but ultimately Footy Japan KK will determine sanctions. In all instances a minimum 3-match ban will be imposed (A player may not play for any other team in TML or FJ Cup while serving this ban). Harsher rulings will be sought where necessary on a case-by-case basis. Repeat offenders can expect to be permanently banned from all Footy Japan KK. organized competitions and events.</p>
																	<p>vi) Any and all acts of physical violence or threatening behaviour including continued verbal abuse towards a TML official, before, during or after a Footy Japan KK. organized event, including TML games, FJ Cup games, tournaments and social events, will result in the automatic and permanent expulsion of the offending player from all Footy Japan KK. organized football, by order of Footy Japan KK.</p>
																</ol>
															</ol>
															<p><b>5. COMMUNICATION WITH TML/FOOTY JAPAN KK PERSONNEL:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>- TML/Footy Japan KK personnel involved in the organisation and governing of the league and cup competitions will, in all cases, only deal with <b><u>TEAM CAPTAINS</u></b> as a representative voice of the whole team/club, or by a <b><u>recognized proxy</u></b>, such as a <b><u>Vice Captain or Treasurer.</u></b> Individual players are <b><u>NOT</u></b> permitted to contact Footy Japan KK. on TML/Footy Japan Cup business, unless asked specifically by the competition organizers to do so. Captains, Vice Captains &amp; Treasurers are strongly advised to <b><u>always</u></b> communicate with Footy Japan KK personnel in a professional, courteous, constructive and productive manner. Solutions to any problems will always be better received than simply highlighting issues. Any communication to Footy Japan KK personnel, be it face-to-face; by e-mail; telephone or any other medium, that is deemed by the company to be insulting, abusive, malicious, defamatory, libellous or threatening; be it directed at an individual or defamatory remarks made about any of Footy Japan KK&rsquo;s operations, will result in the permanent expulsion of the perpetrator from all Footy Japan KK. organized events and competitions.</p>
															</ol>
															<p><b>6. <a name="Anchor-ADMIN_rule" id="Anchor-ADMIN_rule"></a>ADMINISTRATIVE PROTOCOLS</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>-&nbsp;Captains are to provide TML with their &lsquo;<b>intention to register&rsquo;</b> a new player (i.e. A PLAYER NOT PLAYING FOR ANY OTHER TEAM IN THE TML), by e-mail to: <a class="txlink" href="mailto:tmladmin@footyjapan.com">tmladmin@footyjapan.com</a> providing the player&rsquo;s full name, e-mail address and phone number a <b><u>minimum of 24-hours BEFORE</u></b> they play their <b>FIRST game in the TML.</b> Violation of this rule will result in 1-point being deducted, from the offending team.</p>
																<p>-&nbsp; Following this, <b>IF </b>the team decides to register the player, ALL registration information for that player team), including the player&rsquo;s photo, photocopy (or high resolution colour scan) of both sides of Gaijin Card or Japanese Drivers Licence must be provided to: <a class="txlink" href="mailto:tmladmin@footyjapan.com">tmladmin@footyjapan.com</a> <b>before his 2nd TML match</b>. &nbsp;Failure to do this will result in a <b>STRIKE</b> being issued.<b></b></p>
																<p>In short: the <b>&lsquo;intention to register new player&rsquo; </b>procedure is<b> MANDATORY, </b>full registration of that player is at the team&rsquo;s discretion. This allows players not playing in the TML to effectively have a &lsquo;trial&rsquo;.</p>
																<p>-&nbsp; Captains who wish to register a player already playing for a team in ANOTHER division, must provide TML with the player&rsquo;s full name and first team name a <b>minimum of 24-hours BEFORE they play their</b> <b>FIRST game for their new team (&amp; division). </b>Failing to adhere to this rule will result in a 1-point deduction.</p>
																<p>&nbsp;- Players <b><u>may not</u></b> play for another team in the same division without prior transfer approval between both captains and only then once TML organisers have been informed and the proper player registration process has taken place.</p>
																<p> - Players may play for teams in other divisions providing they are properly registered for the team <b>BEFORE THEIR FIRST GAME</b>. Violation of this rule will result in 1-point being deducted, from the offending team. Players may only play for <b>ONE TEAM IN THE FOOTY JAPAN CUP COMPETITION</b>. <b>Cup-tied players who play for another team in the same competition will a) automatically give their opposition a 3-0 forfeit win and b) be suspended for 2-TML matches.</b></p>
																<p><a id="newrule2" name="newrule2"></a><b class="red">Max Pre-reg Quota per match:</b><br>
																	&nbsp;<br>&middot;&nbsp;<b class="red">Teams may only pre-register and use a maximum of 4 pre-reg players per match </b>&#150; (including on-field and sub players)</p>
																<p>&nbsp;- Captains will fill out a team sheet (which they have already downloaded from: <a class="txlink" href="../archive/docs/TMLstatsTemplate_Team.xls" target="_blank"><b>HERE</b></a>), to be emailed to <a class="txlink" href="mailto:tmladmin@footyjapan.com">tmladmin@footyjapan.com</a> by the <b>WEDNESDAY </b>following <b>EVERY TML AND FOOTY JAPAN CUP match. (</b>Teams failing to submit on time will be issued a <b>STRIKE)</b></p>
																<p>- Captains will also ensure that following the game (League or Cup) the referees know the full names of all goal scorers and players who have received cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
															</ol>
															<p><b>      &#x2022; STRIKE/FINE SYSTEM</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>&nbsp;- TML has a <b>zero tolerance policy for late payments of dues and for administrative tardiness.</b> TML has (unfortunately) had to institute a <b>STRIKE</b> system - teams failing to meet administration deadlines (team registration, regular submission of team sheets the following WEDNESDAY after their match, new player registration documents: including player&rsquo;s photo, photocopy of both sides of gaijin card (or high resolution colour scan), or Japanese driver&rsquo;s licence) will be issued a <b>STRIKE. </b>If a team accumulates <b>3-STRIKES</b> during a season they will <b>forfeit 1-point</b> and risk the very real chance of not being invited to participate in the TML in following season. (The STRIKE system will be publicly available on the league tables page of the TML website (http://footyjapan.com/pages/tables.html) <b>Teams highlighted in <span class="green">GREEN = 1st strike</span>, <span class="or">ORANGE = 2nd strike</span>, <span class="red">RED indicates a point has been deducted.</span></b></p>
																<p>&nbsp;- For teams failing to meet payment deadlines for invoices issued to teams for participation in Footy Japan KK. organized competitions, including but not limited to, team registration fees, player registration fees, match fees, the following fines will be imposed and added to the following month&rsquo;s invoice: First late payment: 3,000JPY, Second late payment: 10,000JPY, Third late payment: 20,000JPY. Teams offending more than THREE times will be expelled from the league and Footy Japan KK&rsquo;s legal proxy will collect the outstanding fees owed.</p>
															</ol>
															<p><b>7. ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>It is <b><u class="red">mandatory</u></b> for all teams intending to play in TML Season 7/Footy Japan Cup competition to be represented at the TML AGM, which will be held toward the end of TML Season 6.<b> </b></p>
															</ol>
															<p><b>8. SPONSORS:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>&nbsp;The sponsors of the Tokyo Metropolis League, including Metropolis (magazine), are in no way responsible for the running of this league and as such may <b>NOT</b> be approached about TML/Footy Japan KK. football-related matters.</p>
															</ol>
															<p><b>9. LIABILITY:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>Players registering to play in the Tokyo Metropolis League and all other Footy Japan KK organised competitions, including friendly matches and futsal training, do so in the knowledge that TML &amp; Footy Japan KK will not be held responsible financially or otherwise for any injuries sustained during competition/training. Players are therefore strongly advised to have their own comprehensive medical coverage (insurance) as no claims can or will be accepted by TML or its parent company Footy Japan KK, without exception. Players without sufficient medical coverage, injuries (pre-existing or otherwise), or with any physical or mental condition that could, by playing competitive football (or training), lead to the need for medical attention, are strongly advised not to play in Footy Japan KK. organised competition. Those choosing to ignore this warning do so of their own free will and entirely at their own risk. Footy Japan KK and its operations will accept no liability for any injuries sustained during its operations.</p>
															</ol>
															<p><b class="red">10. Footy Japan Cup:</b></p>
															<ol>
																<p>Players may only play for <b>ONE</b> team during the Footy Japan Cup competition.&nbsp; Regardless of who a player is registered for in the TML, the first game a player plays with a team in the cup competition renders him <b>CUP TIED</b> for the duration of the competition. Once a team is knocked out of the competition, players may not play for another team still remaining in the competition. Failure to adhere to these rules will result in the offending player's team being <b>automatically expelled from the competition</b> - ignorance will be no excuse or defence. <b>It is the captain's responsibility to ensure no cup tied players are fielded in his squad.</b>&nbsp;<br>
																	<br>
																	<b>All new player registration remains the same in accordance with league policy:</b> A minimum of 24-hour notice of intention to register (pre-registration) to be sent to <a class="txlink" href="mailto:competitions.ops@footyjapan.com">competitions.ops@footyjapan.com</a> including: the player's full name, e-mail address and mobile phone number.&nbsp;<br>
																	<br>
																	Team sheets are to be submitted as per TML, by the Wednesday following a match - <b>failure to do so will result in 'strike' sanctions that will be carried to&nbsp;the league</b>.<br>
