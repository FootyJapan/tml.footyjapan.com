													FJ Privacy Policy<br>
												</h2>
												<p>Footy Japan K.K., the company that own and operates the Tokyo Metropolis League; British Football Academy Tokyo; Footy Japan Community and Footy Japan Tournaments divisions, respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. That is why we have adopted this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy. The following policies are only in effect for the Web pages, newsletters, discussion forums and lists and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Footy Japan K.K. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Footy Japan Network includes all Web sites and certain other Internet media properties linked directly or indirectly from the footyjapan.com home page. The following discloses our Privacy Policy.<br>
													<br>
													<b>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it? <br>
													</b><br>
													Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's &quot;Internet Protocol&quot; IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the Footy Japan Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Footy Japan Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.<br>
													<br>
													<b>What are cookies?</b> <br>
													<br>
													From time to time, although not currently in use, the Footy Japan Network may send a &quot;cookie&quot; to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data from your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of Footy Japan's Network you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit, those pages may be readily accessible. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.<br>
