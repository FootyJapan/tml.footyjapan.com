					<p><b>Fujitsu Big Circus, Hon Atsugi, Sun 17th Sept. </b>&ldquo;Come on lads, let&rsquo;s not start sucking each other&rsquo;s d*$ks just yet!&rdquo; came the cry from inspirational BEFC goalie Giles Lever mid-way through the second half of this clash between perennial Metropolis league yo-yo clubs BEFC and Maritizio. Quite what was meant by that comment no one in his own team really knew, but it seemed to have a galvanizing effect for BEFC as they trotted out to a 5-1 victory over their division 2 rivals. Rest assured, nothing was sucked (at least not by this central defender), and the embassy&rsquo;s unbeaten 2006 continues in style. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0917befcvmar.html" target="_blank">more from befc...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 16th Sept.</b> Sala&rsquo;s baffling inability to play from the start cost them two points for the second week in a row at Hachioji on Saturday, as they were again forced to come from two goals down to grab a draw.<br>
						TML league organizer and self styled &lsquo;Tzar of Football&rsquo;, Sala&rsquo;s own Sid Lloyd, is now considering the option of barring first halves altogether, and playing only the second forty minute period. <i>&ldquo;That way we could get two games per booking on every pitch, and when we make it retro-active to the start of the season, Sala will be top of the league, so everyone&rsquo;s a winner.&rdquo;</i> Quoth the Sid. &nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0916gekvsala1.html" target="_blank">more from Sala...</a><br>

					<p><b>OiFuto 2, Sat 9th Sept.</b> What could have been a long, dull and fairly depressing Saturday in Tokyo, was surprisingly converted into a fun filled day of happiness and smiling babies everywhere, thanks to a last minute header by Ozzie stud Beddingfield against BFC, which rescued a draw for a Sala team staring another unfortunate defeat in the face. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0909bfcvsala.html" target="_blank">more from Sala...</a><br>

					<p><b>St Mary's, Sat 9th Sept.</b> Swiss vs. Hibernian is always a tough match, no different this time as the small pitch at St. Mary&rsquo;s really makes it tight with some big lads on display.&nbsp;<br>
						The game ended 0-0 but the Hibs. have to be disappointed not to have come away with the victory.<br>
						<br>
						&nbsp;Numerous chances in the box missed the target entirely (Bevan, Yama, Yohei, Mick) and some were just shot straight at Peter in goal.&nbsp; One of the clear mishaps was Yohei who just kicked the ground instead of the ball in spite of being in oceans of space &#150; the ball ended up rolling softly to Peter.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0909hibsvswiss.html" target="_blank">more from Swiss...</a><br>
						<b>KN.</b><br>
						Well this was indeed 'one of those days' for the Hibs. Not in the way we played, but more the way we performed in front of goal.<br>
						The Hibs v Swiss is always a special game for the Hibs. The Swiss always have a good quality team, have a long and proud history in Tokyo and I have been on the hands of so many defeats too them that victory feels especially sweet.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0909hibsvswiss1.html" target="_blank">more from Hibs...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 3rd Sept.</b> The Celts got their season off to a flying start with a well deserved win over the French. When the fixture was first made, not too many fancied the 10am kick off in Misato on a Sunday morning, but the way things panned out the Celts were happy to get out of the searing heat with 3 points.<br>
						<br>
						Despite missing a number of key players, including last seasons top scorer, and Ruairi &amp; Gav's new management technique of not bothering to do a warm up for fear the lads would have to get there on time the Celts started well and carved open a number of clearcut opportunities with Soh and Roberto going close.<br>
						15 minutes in and the Celts scored their first ever goal in Div 1 of the TML. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0903celtsvfra.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<p><b>St Mary's, Sat 2nd Sept.</b> What a great way to start the new season! A beautiful dry sunny day, blue skies, 26 degrees and a football game in Tokyo! The Jets had not lost a TML game for over 12 months, and had high confidence after a 3-1 win over Sala in their debut game in the first division. They were looking to mark their arrival with style than a victory over the title defending Hibs. The Hibs had worked hard over summer to keep our fitness and match sharpness. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0902jetsvhibs.html" target="_blank">more from Hibs...</a><br>

						After a good result at the new Oi turf pitch against Sala to inaugurate their Div 1 season last week, the Jets knew they would be in for a tougher test against the TML 1 league champion at the Hibs' bumpy St. Marys home ground. Despite rumours that the Hibs were missing a few key players, the Jets, also missing a few strong players, started the game cautiously with just one up front. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0902jetsvhibs1.html" target="_blank">more from JETS...</a><br>
