					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 31st March</b>, Saitama Jets eased their relegation worries with a come-from-behind victory over an ill-tempered France side at Hachiogi Park early on Saturday morning. The French opened the scoring against the run of play midway through the first half and were still in front as the game entered the final 15 minutes, but two clinical finishes from Nate Gildart snatched all three points for the team from Saitama.<br>

						The result leaves the top of the table even less clear than before, although BFC&rsquo;s random thrashing of YCAC puts them in the driving seat. Sala now slip one point behind Swiss and with a crunch game against the Hibs coming right up, are perhaps, to extend the metaphor, in the middle of the back seat wearing the instant death inducing lap belt. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0331swissvsala1.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						It was a solid effort from the boys with hard work in midfield making it tough for the Chiba beer boys to connect much and the defensive unit looked unsettled only once or twice with Shigeru&rsquo;s overlapping runs.&nbsp;The lack of Guido in the first half and Andreas&rsquo; &nbsp;recent departure made things a little bit easier, more time on the ball and good runs out of midfield. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0331swissvsala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

They, YCAC that is,&nbsp;managed to beat WSG 4-1 on Sunday despite playing possibly their worst 40 minutes of this season and probably quite a few gone by too. The Geckoes were not alone&nbsp;in wondering just how they managed to be losing 2-1 as they trooped off for the intermission after playing, at least at times, YCAC off the park in the 1st period. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0324ycacvwsg.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

Unfortunately not the case these days as the Hibs once again lined up without a single Irishman in the squad against the Celts 7. Times are changing and so is the Celts fortune as they won a deserved point in a physical game in Hodogaya on Sunday. &nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0325hibsvcelts1.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

It is no secret that we have hit a lean spell, but we had been buoyed by a strong showing, including a victory over the Celts in the previous week&rsquo;s Dubliner&rsquo;s cup. After an unlucky loss against France in reality we had to win this one to still be in a chance of winning the league. &#x2026;. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0325hibsvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 18th March</b>, Fair enough; rain and probably even snow is preferable to the squally wind and bright sun today. Visibility was poor &#150; the howling wind and dust clouds that swirled about the pitch made you want to pack up and go picking peaches in California. Wyatt Earpe shot one of the Clantons under similar conditions. It was impossible to judge distances or flight of the ball with the sun beaming through the dust.<br>
						<br>
						Moaning aside, a player to watch in the coming year is Paul Wadsworth &#150; he gets more important in every game. Even on a day like this his play had the delicacy of truffles. Muzzy would have certainly scored a hatrick today if his left eye didn't become sightless and grotesque after a blast of dust. Still in his brief 10 minutes at the start he scored the key first goal, a short rebound, and showed a return to his electric momentum last seen in full in the BEFC game..&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0318vagsvamanis.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						What with veteran ankle biter Brian Gallagher off to Aichi this month, Sala are desperately lacking in midfield tenacity and Andres will be sadly missed.

						With Hibs and Swiss contriving to lose more matches in the last month than they have in the previous three seasons, the chance was there for Sala or YCAC to open up a gap on the Old Firm and remind the league leaders that the fat lady hasn&rsquo;t finished warming up her vocal chords quite yet.
