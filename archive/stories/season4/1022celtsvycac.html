								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 22nd Oct.</b> This was a competitive and hard fought game between two organised and committed teams, never in danger of being accused of beautiful football. Little separated the two sides apart from some tactical shouting from the YCAC bench that ultimately settled the issue. The Celts played well throughout but struggled to penetrate the YCAC defence which played a high line to squeeze the skilful Celts midfield (well that was the plan anyway). <br>
									<br>
									The Celts came closest to scoring in the first half when Gary Hodgson produced fine reaction saves to deny the skilful So Sugasawa and stylish but completely ineffective Argentine Eduardo Romaneiro. YCAC responded with several dangerous crosses into the Celts penalty area which were not properly cleared and resulted in the ball bouncing off the cross bar twice. Damian Hart then met a corner with a firm header and had the Celts goalkeeper beaten only to see veteran defender Chris Moores deflect the goal bound effort expertly with his face.  Soon after YCAC holding midfielder Anthony Savage stroked a dangerous shot just over the bar which ultimately landed in Hokkaido after catching the attention of air traffic controllers at Narita. YCAC then shouted long and hard for a penalty just before half time after a goal bound shot by Satoshi was blocked by Ben Reeder in the penalty area.<br>
									<br>
									In the second half play was balanced with both teams cancelling each other out with the forwards struggling to create clear goal chances in the face of committed and competent displays from both defences. YCAC did have another effort bounce off the Celts crossbar with the goal keeper beaten.<br>
									<br>
									The decisive moment in the game came half way through the second half when YCAC centre forward James Absolom was subjected to a Mortal Kombat style assault after Gary Hodgson guided a cunning through ball into the Celts penalty area from seventy yards. Joe Takeda took the resulting penalty and sent the impressive Akihiro in the Celts goal the wrong way for what would be the winning goal.<br>
									<br>
									The referee was then called upon on a number of occasions to book players and some fists were thrown on both sides after which YCAC were reduced to ten men for retaliation. The YCAC players protested that only their player was penalised when a further red card seemed justified to punish both offenders but this seemed to galvanise their effort.<br>
									<br>
									YCAC centre forward Matt had a chance to decide the game when put through but Akihiro made an excellent save diving low to his left to push the shot onto the post.<br>
									<br>
									The Celts may be disappointed not to secure a point from the game and will regret not using their possession towards the end of the game to create further chances. YCAC will be disappointed that Phil Denham is still getting a game for them. Alas, life is full of mystery and tragedy.<br>
									<br>
									On this form and given their strong squad the newly promoted Celts will trouble most sides in this league, particularly when they build on their strengths up front. YCAC will be happy (and relieved) with the three points given their inconsistent start to the season and list of absentees on Sunday. <br>
									<br>
									Best for the Celts were Akihiro, Dermot Hanlon and Wayne Bentley. Best for YCAC were Gary Hodgson, Anthony &ldquo;the Ginger General&rdquo; Savage and the evergreen defensive pairing of Dickie Philo and Damian Hart. .<br>
