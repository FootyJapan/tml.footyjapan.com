The 13 candidates who participated in the Level 2 course held two weeks earlier at the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club, will be hoping for similar news come their final assessments next spring.<br>
									<br>
									&ldquo;The candidates were well above average to be fair,&rdquo; says FA Coach Educator Stephen Lister during a course debrief. &ldquo;And it was nice to have such a mixed bunch on the course. <img src="../../../mats/photos/06/FAJapan1.jpg" alt="" height="217" width="283" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">Aside from English candidates living in Japan, there were Americans, a Romanian, a candidate from Finland, as well as Scottish, Welsh and of course Japanese candidates,&rdquo; he says.<br>
									<br>
									Japan is a hotbed of football aficionados and if the game&rsquo;s popularity continues to increase at such a rate it won&rsquo;t be long before football overtakes baseball as the country&rsquo;s national sport. However for the scores of international football enthusiasts working or studying in the Land of the Rising Sun, looking to pursue a hobby or etch out a career in coaching football in Japan, gaining the requisite qualifications, until recently had been something of an arduous task. <br>
									<br>
									&ldquo;<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/FAJapan4.jpg" alt="" height="188" width="283" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">2-years before enrolling on this course I had thought about going abroad to take a residential coaching course, but time and money were prohibitive factors,&rdquo; remembers Mike &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo; Yeomans, an English teacher in Japan and candidate on both the Level 1 and Level 2 course. &ldquo;When I heard The FA were making the courses available in Japan I was absolutely thrilled and having now passed my Level 1 and working towards getting my Level 2 I&rsquo;m indebted to The FA whose courses far exceeded my expectations,&rdquo; he says.<br>
									 <br>
									A football resource company operating in Japan called Footy Japan Ltd mediated the two FA courses in Japan. The company run the British Football Academy in Tokyo, a series of progressive football schools for children aged 3 to 15, and have a vested interest in the continued development of high quality FA qualified coaches in Japan.<br>
									<br>

									&ldquo;The FA sanctioning these courses to run in Japan was fantastic news for us,&rdquo; says Sid Lloyd, Managing Director of Footy Japan Ltd. &ldquo;It means that the bar will be raised on coaching standards and practices in Japan and hopefully the British Football Academy will become a benchmark for local Japanese as well as other international football schools operating in Japan. We&rsquo;re so grateful to all the FA personnel at Soho Square, the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire CFA and Stephen Lister himself for working so hard to make this happen and seeing it through to such positive fruition,&rdquo; he says. <br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/FAJapan6.jpg" alt="" height="188" width="283" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">Spreading the message of the English game of football, in Japan, was one motivating factor underpinning Stephen Lister&rsquo;s tireless endeavours in Japan.<br>
									<br>
									&ldquo;The rules and regulations of the game are the same the world over. In football there&rsquo;s one ball and two goals &#150; essentially we all play the same game, but for me it was great to see the differences in the candidates&rsquo; approach to coaching football. Take one of my Level 2 candidates for example, Florin Cumpata from Romania, he had a unique take on the game a put a great deal of emphasis on its technical aspects, at no point did I say to him that his approach was wrong and the English way right &#150; infact I think we both learnt a lot from each other. The candidates were very receptive to new ideas and this shows their open-mindedness, by the third day of the (Level 2) course they&rsquo;d all come around to my way of thinking,&rdquo; quips Stephen Lister, himself a holder of the UEFA &lsquo;A&rsquo; Advanced Licence and one of The FA&rsquo;s Lead Tutors.<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/FAJapan7.jpg" alt="" height="188" width="283" align="left" border="0" hspace="3"><br>
									&ldquo;On behalf of the English Football Association I&rsquo;d like to thank Footy Japan Ltd. for choosing The FA to be coach education providers and facilitators,&rdquo; continues Stephen Lister. &ldquo;And we wish Footy Japan all the success they deserve in the future. Big Brother will be watching.&rdquo;<br>
