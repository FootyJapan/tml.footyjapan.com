								<p><b>Misato, Sun 1st Oct.</b> Swiss vs. Celts on a great day for a match at Misato &#150; nice grass and a cool cloud cover meant that all the excuses in the world couldn&rsquo;t help &#150; ability was going to be the deciding factor on the day.&nbsp; The Celts are a decent side, relegating the Irish players to defense and using all nationalities in attack &#150; Czechs, Japanese, and some Latin flair.&nbsp; The only Irishman in the Swiss half of the pitch was Kirk, holding down the fort for the Swiss.&nbsp; The Swiss were somewhat depleted on the day with two of their best players away for the weekend; fortunately, Dierk, Dale, and Angelo made their first appearances of the season for us and were solid.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The game started with the Celts looking more lively.&nbsp; They held up the ball well in midfield and were connecting well with &lsquo;So&rsquo; up front and Roberto coming through midfield.&nbsp; One of the recruits from the Shogun Knights, the largest physical specimen in the TML, was dominant in the air and and useful on the ground. &nbsp;He created their first chance with a nice through ball to &lsquo;So&rsquo; who had gotten behind Dierk &#150; Dierk couldn&rsquo;t control himself and tapped him on the shoulder. &nbsp;The resulting death roll was impressive and the ref. pointed to the spot.&nbsp; The spot kick was placed to the right, the Swiss Doctor parried it well with a dive but &lsquo;tit man&rsquo; Dale was admiring his fans in the stands (or maybe himself) and failed to clear the rebound, allowing his attacker to get to it first to knock it in past a stranded Peter. &nbsp;Peter gave his usual howl when a mistake has been made but the score line read 1-0 to the Celts and it was deserved.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									This seemed to spark the Swiss and some nice football resulted.&nbsp; Andy came on at left back which allowed Kai to move up front while Dale in midfield evened things up a little with the Terminator lurking.&nbsp; Kai went straight to work and one of his first plays was a great through pass to Karl who tried to volley it left footed only for it to just miss the right post. &nbsp;The next chance fell to Kai himself and he took on two defenders, the first with pure speed and the second with a nice pull back off the end line allowing himself time to slot it in at the near post, a great individual effort.&nbsp; He produced another beauty about 5 minutes later beating the same guy twice &#150; unfortunately for Kai, the keeper stopped his frist effort but Philip followed it up and knocked it in for a 2-1 Swiss lead.&nbsp; It was a great comeback after a very shakey start. The first half finished that way and the Swiss were starting to get more comfortable with the players on the pitch.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The second half got a little more physical with some solid tackles by Dierk and with Andy taking some offense to an elbow to the midsection. &nbsp;The Celts tried to push forward more but crosses were not being met and the marking and covering by the Swiss back four were up to the task. &nbsp;Going the other way, Uchida had a one on one vs. the keeper which he could have done better with while JP&rsquo;s slow motion header merely floated over the bar.&nbsp; It was eventually an individual effort by Angelo which clinched the 3 points for the Swiss as JP played it in to his feet, he was stopped once but kept on working and eventually found space to get off a weak left footed shot.&nbsp; It looked like the keeper&rsquo;s dive would be enough but it just snuck in the lower right corner.&nbsp; It was a nice piece of work by Angelo.&nbsp; The final 10 minutes were typical TML with the Celts pushing more men forward in the hope of sneaking a goal &#150; fortunately the Swiss back four stayed put and the balls were picked off more and more easily.&nbsp; A few counter attacks resulted but the scoreline stayed the same. &nbsp;Final result 3-1, the Swiss have to keep winning with the Hibs. already establishing a large goal differential. Good effort but we have to do more as a team to score goals, relying on individual efforts won&rsquo;t do it in the big games.&nbsp; A final word, well done by the ref. who was consistent and on top of the game. &nbsp;Both teams complained too much but he kept control and dealt with everything.<br>
