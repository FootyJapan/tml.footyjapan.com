									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 8th April</b>, A very even game between two mid-table sides saw Hibs scrape a 1-0 victory. The football was not helped by the beach in the centre of the field.<br>
										<br>
										It was an end-to-end game with very few chances, with both keepers making several excellent saves and both teams defending well.<br>
										<br>
										The game was won in the first half by two of the Hibs new boys fresh from Roppoingi with only 2 hours sleep between them. An excellent ball high through the centre of the Sala defense from Robert was chested down by Andre on the run which took him past the two Sala central defenders and into the box, followed by a cool finish.<br>
										<br>
										The second half was easier to defend with the wind. Sala had two great chances to score and Michael had a shot cleared off the line. With time running out, Sala started to attack with more determination, but the Hibs defense was solid.<br>
										<br>
										We lacked organization at times with big gaps in the centre of midfield and gave the ball away too easily towards the end of the game. But we are back to our winning ways and need to keep this going until the end of the season.<br>
										<br>
										It was a team effort in the end on a very hot day in the middle of nowhere.<br>
										<br>
										A victory against the Swiss next week on the same beach will take us third in the table with a game in-hand over YCAC.<br>
