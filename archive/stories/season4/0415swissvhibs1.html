									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, The Hibs and the Swiss are out of the running for the 2007 league title, but still managed to dig deep and find things to play for on a Sunday morning at Misato.<br>
										<br>
										 The Hibs' injury woes reached new heights when Jay's dad, who had come just to watch the game, pulled a muscle before the starting whistle. They had a bigger loss when Captain Naoki went down 10 minutes into the first half, for a full 11 starters lost this season - congrats also to Ike, Bevan, Kuni H, Yama, Mick, Yohei, Josh, Steve, Keita and Sam.<br>
										<br>
										 The game was physical and hard-fought from the start, with the Hibs attempting to get their passing game going on the bubbly pitch and the Swiss pounding long balls up to its two big forwards.&nbsp; <br>
										 Both strategies yielded chances in the first half, with the Swiss keeper forced into making several saves and the Hibs' Hitoshi also parrying a point-blank shot wide.&nbsp; Advantage Hibs, especially when Andre came on midway through to create several chances, but nothing to show for it - score tied 0-0 at the half.<br>
										<br>
										 The Hibs looked much stronger early in the second half, with Tomo back to his normal midfield spot after playing forward earlier. He set up a few near misses before beating two defenders himself and scoring on a bubbly shot lower right. 1 - 0 to the Hibs,&nbsp;making Tomo officially again the league's leading scorer. The Hibs then began to pull back a bit, with the Swiss throwing numbers forward supported by the Misato jet stream. The Hibs looked like they would pull it out until about two minutes to go, when a good cross was brought down nicely by a Swiss attacker who was then tripped up in the box. Kirk stepped up to calmly score the PK, bringing him back even with Tomo&nbsp; for season goals. 1-1, game over.<br>
										 The Hibs were once again left shaking their heads over a game they&nbsp; should've won versus the Swiss, who were visibly happy to have pulled out another draw.<br>
										 A big cheer for Steve Taw from YCAC, who filled in as ref for most of the match after playing in the previous game, and did a great job as well..<br>
