									<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 4th March</b>, The Geckoes continued their good run with a fine 2-0 victory over the French in a tight and friendly affair (only because the abuse was in French and so we couldn?t understand it). Goals from Tom Kiley and Mikkel Troen in each half ensured that the Geckoes got the 3 points and march up to the dizzying heights of 6th place in the table.<br>
										The game started brightly for the Geckoes with Kazu having a couple of good chances that he put just over. Kazu then set up the still drunk Tom Kiley to hammer home from 10 yards and give the Geckoes a justified lead.<br>
										The French then came back into the game and had a goal controversially (not really) chalked off from a corner. The Geckoes were in the process of making a substitution and the ref called a halt to the play to allow the substitution to be made. The French took a corner, scored and couldn't understand why the goal wasn't given claiming that you didn't need to wait for the whistle<br>
										<br>
										The half finished 1-0 to the Geckoes but both sides had had chances to score with Geckoes keeper Charles making a couple of good saves.<br>
										The Geckoes started the second half the stronger of the two teams and scored the second on the hour mark. Kazu was brought down outside of the box and Mikkel curled the free kick over the wall to make it 2-0.<br>
										It then became a much more open game and the Geckoes defence led by Kevin and Yu stood firm against strong French pressure. At the other end, Rob had a couple of good chances to make the game safe but was prevented by the French keeper. In the last couple of minutes the French hit the bar and there was still time for the ref to finally issue a yellow card for dissent before blowing the full time whistle.<br>
										An excellent performance from the Geckoes, led by a strong back line and for the second week running a clean sheet. Long may it continue!<br>
