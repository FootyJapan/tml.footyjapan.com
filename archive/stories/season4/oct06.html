					<p><b>Oi Futo, Sun 29th Oct.</b> The Barbs team bus rolled up to the Famous Oi Futo Dirt Stadium on a day where conditions were perfect for a display of the beautiful game, unfortunately the pitch looking remarkably like the new Wembley before they lade the grass, wasn't going to suit the silky skills of the Barbs academy of football.<br>
						<br>
						Barbs lined up in the new strip, well ten of us did, the other players deciding to sleep off their hangovers on the back of the bus, so some American bloke decided he'd show us how they play &quot;soccer&quot; back in the states and help us make the bare 11.<br>

					<p><b>Oi Futo, Sun 29th Oct.</b> The muddy field of Oi was not the best time for Lions to unveil their new white kit or even play after a 6 week absence.<br>
						<br>
						Lions again were missing some crucial players, this time the back four! Defensive midfielders filled in for the defence, and some confidence was inspired by the debut of the experienced keeper Mike.<br>
						<br>
						10 minutes into the game, Lions fell victim to a clever quick free-kick by Shane, playing their winger onside, who stepped into the 18 yard box and unleashed a venomous shot to the right of the keeper, who had no chance.<br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 22nd Oct.</b> It's been a while but WSG finally managed to get a full team out for the first time this season, and what a difference a good squad can make. WSG opened the scoring on the 20-minute mark after Mikkel Troen went on a run in the 18 yard box, having gone past about 5 challenges he was brought down in the area. Taking the penalty himself he made no mistake from the spot.<br>
						<br>
						WSG kept on the attack and really should have been at least 3 up at half time having squandered a few chances, which may have been attributed to the bobbly conditions on the Misato grass.<br>

Little separated the two sides apart from some tactical shouting from the YCAC bench that ultimately settled the issue. The Celts played well throughout but struggled to penetrate the YCAC defence which played a high line to squeeze the skilful Celts midfield (well that was the plan anyway).<br>

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 15th Oct.</b> A thoroughly entertaining game of football was fought out on the heights of YCAC&rsquo;s ground despite the perennial wind, which often dictates the areas of action at this venue. The grounds man can take great credit having watered the pitch in the morning and for having left the grass a decent length; the two combined to allow a level of controlled football, which isn&rsquo;t always associated with this ground<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						YCAC went into the game minus several first team players but started with the wind at their backs. The first twenty minutes saw a game with a tight, highly contested midfield and no shots to test either keeper. The only moment of note was a superbly executed free kick from Andres which found Toby behind the wall but his header lacked the killer touch.<br>

						It was a perfect day Saturday on the million-dollar pitch at St. Mary's and the TML's top two squads were up for it. Plenty of drama here - last year the Hibs won the war but lost the battle, as YCAC was the only team we didn't beat.<br>
						<br>
						The teams have very different styles, with YCAC's shock and awe devastation through long balls and crosses versus the Hibs quick passing and Yama's custom-made gold shoes.

The game was full of incident and concluded on the wet grass at Misato with the French reduced to 9-men and flamboyant referee Pietro Cristo vowing never to officiate another TML game again.<br>

						BFC started the game poorly failing to clear their lines on the slippery surface and the French were gifted the first goal of the game with a simple tap-in that left BFC keeper Beef Jryki little chance. This was enough to awaken the sleeping beast that was BFC and in an instant the team responded, playing two-touch football out of the back and hitting the strikers on the move from midfield &#150; Al Himmer holding up the ball well, shrugging off defenders and laying off simply to the overlapping runners.<br>
