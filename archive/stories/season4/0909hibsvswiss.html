								<p><b>St Mary's, Sat 9th Sept.</b> Swiss vs. Hibernian is always a tough match, no different this time as the small pitch at St. Mary&rsquo;s really makes it tight with some big lads on display.&nbsp; <br>
									The game ended 0-0 but the Hibs. have to be disappointed not to have come away with the victory.<br>
									<br>
									&nbsp;Numerous chances in the box missed the target entirely (Bevan, Yama, Yohei, Mick) and some were just shot straight at Peter in goal.&nbsp; One of the clear mishaps was Yohei who just kicked the ground instead of the ball in spite of being in oceans of space &#150; the ball ended up rolling softly to Peter.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									The Swiss should be happy with the draw as a good first half really deteriorated in the 2H as a lack of fitness and perhaps a lack of ability in attack really forced the team to defend.&nbsp; We threatened 2-3 times at best in a long 2H while the midfield was having difficulty keeping up with the waves of attacks coming back the other way.&nbsp; Bevan, Tomo, Yohei, and Kuni kept flowing through and it was difficult as the match wore on.&nbsp; Dave P. tried to drive through on counter attacks but they were lonely runs much of the time.&nbsp; The defense did well to keep the ball out but Peter was called on too frequently as the numbers of Hibs. in space were just too much.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									Cho was great, marking Yohei throughout the game and Rafaelle was rabid as usual &#150; Suzuki did well again at left back and he might find it difficult to get back into midfield with performances like that.&nbsp; Some positives to take away were that ball moved around the pitch well when we could keep it and the team stayed positive throughout the game.&nbsp; The Swiss need to look at the positives as we head back to the larger pitch at Oifuto for the next matchup.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									It certainly was a better start to the season than last year&rsquo;s 1-5 demolition (by the Hibs. at St. Mary&rsquo;s) so hopefully we can start working on that goal differential that already looms large.&nbsp; Lastly, great match by Ricky the ref. who kept everyone honest all game.<b><br>Report &#150; Capn.
