									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 17th Feb. </b>BFC overcame Saitama Jets 2-1 on a rain-swept evening at Hachioji Koen with a late goal in a competitive and entertaining encounter.  BFC took the lead early in the second half with a low 25 yard shot that appeared to wrong-foot the Jets&rsquo; goalkeeper, man-of-the-match Kousuke Harada.  The Jets then equalized direct from a corner courtesy of set piece specialist Tomo Kobayashi, but were left empty handed by a late BFC winner, scored via a piece of quick thinking from a free kick on the edge of the area.<br>
										<br>
										Having achieved what many said was impossible in their last TML game &#150; getting YCAC to play outside Yokohama - the Jets were looking for something even more miraculous against BFC - to garner some points for the first time since October.  Whilst the British were looking to continue the form that had seen them go top in TML 1, handing heavy defeats to both the Hibs and the Swiss in the last month.  With both sides desperate for points, although occasionally heated, it never threatened to boil over and despite the physical nature of the game it was played in good spirit with both teams and the ref&rsquo; all on talking terms after the final whistle.<br>
										<br>
										The rain started, as it so often does, a few minutes after kick off and the game quickly settled into a pattern that would last the entire 1st half - BFC knocking the ball around well and the Jets working hard to deny space, win the ball back and launch counter attacks.  The first chance fell to the British, exposing a gaping hole in the centre of the Jets&rsquo; defence they worked the ball across to the unmarked right winger inside the box for what should have been the opener, but a poor first touch allowed Harada to smother the ball at the attackers feet.  It was to be the first of many saves on what would prove to be a busy evening for the Saitama &lsquo;keeper.  The Jets had the next chance, Eite blazing over after doing well to get on the end of Sasaki&rsquo;s long pass and beat his marker.  Despite lots of possession BFC were finding chances hard to come by as Saitama&rsquo;s defence and midfield closed down tirelessly and tackled ferociously.  BFC&rsquo;s young Japanese speed-merchant, Shousuke, had unsurprisingly been identified as one of the main danger men and the South African rottweiller, Botta, was detailed to mark him, backed up left back Bentz and whoever else happened to be in the vicinity.  There must be more enjoyable ways for young Japanese males spend their Saturday evening than by getting knocked around by gaijin on a wet football pitch in Saitama &#150; but he apparently doesn&rsquo;t care for them.  Despite taking some punishment he was always game and whilst winning a fair few free kicks couldn&rsquo;t really be accused of diving &#150; no doubt he has a few bumps and bruises to prove it.<br>
										<br>
										If the Jets&rsquo; felt they had answered all the questions asked of them in the first half, they had no reply to the football the British put together for the first 20 minutes of the second half.  It is no exaggeration to say that the Jets were pummeled, being subjected to wave after wave of attack as BFC pressed for the opener.  Several optimistic penalty appeals were made as the ball pinged around inside the area and Harada made two astonishing reaction saves from shots inside the six yard box.  His numerous other saves, including diving full stretch to turn away a rocket destined for the top corner were merely excellent.  It was during this period that BFC finally breached the Saitama defence - a 25 yard effort which nestled in the corner of the goal with Harada seemingly unsighted.  Fortunate not to be further behind the Jets started to get back into the game midway through the 2nd half.  Loren, pouncing on a ball inside the BFC half, used all his pace and power to get to the edge of the box and hit a drive that, taking a slight deflection of an accompanying defender, looked to be heading into the far top corner but curled just wide at the last moment.  It was from the resulting corner, a vicious in-swinger to the near post, that the Jets leveled the match.  The defender on the post lost concentration momentarily and stepped out allowing the ball to fly into the net.  There was a moment of silent disbelief before, to the Jets&rsquo; jubilation and British despair, everyone realized that Kobayashi had scored directly from the corner.  Suddenly things had become very interesting.  The British started to press again and the Jets&rsquo; began to look ragged and a change of formation was needed to steady things, switching to a 5 man midfield, bringing the pacy and nimble-footed Shimizu on up front.  The Jets looking to defend their point and hit on the counter started playing with more confidence and were even dreaming of a possible victory as BFC left a few gaps at the back as they desperately sought to win the game.  Things seemed to be going to plan until a controversial free kick was awarded on the edge of the Saitama area.  The British claimed handball whilst the Jets argued that their man was pushed from behind, the linesman seemed to be on a break a good 10 yards behind the play.  The decision went to the British and whilst the Jets&rsquo; were still trying to organize, a cheeky ball was played into an unmarked Evans who crashed it home off the underside of the bar from 15 yards.  Gutted, the men from Saitama could only continue complaining to the ref&rsquo;, which has never changed anything.  With only about 8 minutes left to play the Jets&rsquo; immediately switched back to 4-4-2 and started chasing the game.  The British suddenly seemed unsure of themselves and started playing a few nervous balls across the defence and midfield which the Jets&rsquo; were quick to capitalize on, forcing BFC back and winning a couple of corners.  With just a minute left on the clock Osawa, who&rsquo;d enjoyed a standout game at right back, once again popped up in the right wing position laying a nice ball off to Keating, who, in what was the last meaningful action of the game, slipped between two static defenders and lashed a low shot from 20 yards which beat the &lsquo;keeper but agonizingly thumped against the foot of the post and rebounded to a grateful BFC defender to clear.<br>
										Once again the Jets came up a little short but in another good performance pushed the league leaders all the way.  This was a great game to play in and special mention must go to stand-in ref&rsquo; Brian Gallagher who did a great job of letting a fiercely contested game flow.<br>
