								<p><b>OiFuto Dai Ni, Sun 27th August.</b> It&rsquo;s lovely, that new pitch at Oi Futo, lovely lovely lovely. It&rsquo;s also huge &#150; so huge in fact that one end is now on Tennozu Isle and the other encroaches on runway 2 of Haneda Airport. Another curiosity is, does anyone know what sport is played within those red lines there, the arcs and dashes and obtuse angles and the like? Kabbadi perhaps&#x2026;<br>
									<br>
									None of which helped Sala at all, and all of which helped Saitama to their first win in Division 1. Two unanswered goals in the first half gave Saitama a perfect start to their new campaign, and left Sala pondering the oft-asked question &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we score?&rdquo;<br>
									<br>
									Saitama scored in the first 45 seconds, which must be some kind of TML-fastest-goal-div-one-up-from-div-two-start-to-the-season-type of record you would think. After kicking off, they moved the ball forward through the middle and then wide to their left winger, who caused problems for much of the first half. After taking it to the goal line and threatening to shoot, he pulled it back across the 6-yard box. One blue and one white shirt went for the 50-50 ball, which pinged into the top left hand corner. Saitama jubilant, Sala somewhat stunned.<br>
									<br>
									At least this left Sala in a comfortingly familiar situation though; being one-nil down shortly after kick off. It has become, in fact, their standard game plan, and they are getting very good at it.  Other teams beware this season. And in these situations, it&rsquo;s difficult to disagree with Howard Wilkinson &#150; &ldquo;I'm a firm believer that if the other side scores first you have to score twice to win.&rdquo; Astute stuff indeed.<br>
									<br>
									For the next 15 minutes, things were pretty even. The game was played mostly in the middle of the park, Sala trying to establish a passing rhythm, Saitama trying to disrupt. And from a seemingly innocuous push forward came Saitama&rsquo;s second. Sala gained possession just outside their own box and then faffed around with the ball. (something else they are becoming adept at) It fell to the feet of a Saitama player with just the keeper to beat. Price came out, both went the same way but a well-controlled shot put the ball under the keeper and into the goal.<br>
									<br>
									Sala tried hard to get back into it though. Lenny on the left, sporting a nice new shade of auburn burnt-ash no7 tint for the active man, dipped into his bag of tricks but the errant final pass, some ropey finishing and resolute Saitama tackling meant it was 2-nil at half-time.<br>
									<br>
									But as Bobby Robson put it, &ldquo;the first 90 minutes are the most important,&rdquo; Well, 80 minutes in the TML but Sala firmly believes that the observation is readily transferable to the restricted code, and so they set about the latter portion of the most important period of the game.<br>
									<br>
									Tactically, there wasn&rsquo;t much to change from Sala&rsquo;s perspective. Ian came on for Doug at right back to make his TML debut and soon made his presence felt with a stout and sturdy challenge on a swiftly advancing Saitama player down the left. For a lengthy period, Sala enjoyed the lion&rsquo;s share of possession and territory and clearly longed for a goal. Toby and Lenny went close a few times, corners came and went, but Saitama&rsquo;s defence were equal to the pressure, their keeper in particular saving the day (no pun intended) on several occasions.<br>
									<br>
									But it was from a corner that their only goal came around the 60 minute mark. Ian put in from the right and 2 or 3 went up for the header, which ended up around the penalty spot. Guido struck it with such force that it nearly took the skin clean off Clarkey&rsquo;s smooth pate on its way to the top left corner. Certainly a deserved score that set up an interesting final third of the most important period of the game.<br>
									<br>
									Saitama continued to defend with vigour, and did so for a good 15 minutes, keeping out a number of Sala chances, but that&rsquo;s all they were &#150; chances.<br>
									<br>
									A big pitch means more space to counter, and Saitama came at Sala a few times on the right side after Sala had been pushing forward. This caused Sala to rally quickly as it were, especially after one move when Saitama had the ball on the edge of the box. There was a 50-50 challenge which was not clearly seen by the ref, as he awarded the attacking free kick based on the colour of the prone shirt &#150; one player standing, one player down ergo foul. One looks forward to the day when people who have actually played the game put themselves forward for reffing courses. Still, they do look nice in their shiny black uniforms with the FIFA badge on the front.<br>
									<br>
									But Sala were never going to get back into it. About 10 minutes before the end, and again coming from the tricky Saitama left wing (I think), they took the ball to the corner of the box and put in a, well, an unextraordinary shot that seemed bound for the keeper. But players have a habit of screwing up a keeper&rsquo;s good intentions, and a mix of one blue shirt and one white shirt intervened to send the ball whizzing past the unsuspecting keeper for Saitama&rsquo;s 3rd. Actually, it was a deft touch from the Saitama player. It could be argued that it was against the run of play, but who cares, a goal is as they say a goal, and 3-1 it finished.<br>
									<br>
									Surely both sides would agree that the game was balanced enough for a draw, as surely as there will be a number among Saitama Jets who feel the score was perhaps flattering. There are Sala players who would feel the game was more balanced for a draw in the other direction&#x2026;.<br>
									<br>
									Without wishing to sound patronising, Saitama Jets have really improved in the last 2 seasons, and should be looking for a top-half-of-the-table finish, perhaps better. (And you can quote me on that) They have the determination and the manpower to do it.<br>
									<br>
									But let&rsquo;s leave the final word with Glenn Hoddle. It&rsquo;s not about possession or territory, number of shots on target or corners won, eccentric refereeing, chances created or missed opportunities, it&rsquo;s about the ball going across the opposition&rsquo;s goal line. Saitama managed it 3 times and Sala once. As Glenn wisely noted, Sala &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t quite have the run of the mill&rdquo;, and in this league it&rsquo;s very often the run of the mill that grinds the points. <br>
