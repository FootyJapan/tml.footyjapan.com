									<p><b>OiFuto, Saturday 5th May</b>, We went into our 2nd last match of the season with position on the ladder the only goal to aim for, our season that began with a bang and had been finishing with a whimper. Despite going out of the cup and falling out of the running for the league several weeks before, perhaps we could muster enough talent to see our way past bottom placed Jetro in our second last match of the year. <br>
										Perhaps not. <br>
										Jetro are somewhat of an enigma bagging a win over Swiss the week before being beaten 6-0 by a fellow cellar dweller. They always have some ability going forward but are generally leaky at the back and holders of Jetro defenders in their TML fantasy leagues would have been long regretting their 5th beer on auction night last July. The Hibs were down to a bare 11 including Nigel who had not been seen in Hibs colours.... since they were known as the Albion, prior to the TML, and even prior to the millennium. Due to further injuries to Naoki, Hitoshi donned his street clothes and played centre back with aplomb. Nigel filled in in goal and Nao played his first Hibs match of the season. <br>
										<br>
										We went down after 5 minutes as a slight deflection to a Jetro shot left Nigel flat footed. We equalized in the second half as Tomo received a great ball from Mike McG and lobbed the oncoming keeper with ease. Jetro went ahead again when a free kick from 25 yard sailed over Nigel&rsquo;s head before Tomo eaqualised again 10 minutes out. <br>
										In one of the final attacks of the game Keita slightly mis-hit a cross field ball while under pressure and Jetro finished on the break to win it 3-2. While most Hibsmen are looking forward to the summer break, we do regret not helping our kinsmen the Celts in their relegation battle. If anything this result served make to battle at the bottom of the table more interesting with the Geckoes and France now well and truly in the thick of it. At the top of the table congratulations to new champions the BFC. They are worthy winners.<br>
