								<p><b>Misato, Sun 12th Nov.</b> Spirits high after their comfortable win over bottom-of-the-tabke Jetro&nbsp;in the quagmire of Oi Mud, Sala travelled this week to windy Misato to take on the all-conquering top-of-the-table Hibs.&nbsp; Sala had reason to be apprehensive heading into the match after conceding an astonishing total of 16 goals in the last two encounters between the two sides.&nbsp; Preparations weren`t helped when playmaker Shige again ventured to the wrong ground.&nbsp; In the absence of defensive stalwart Clarkey and strikers Roddy Charles and Giles Legg, Guido opted for a cautious approach, employing an unfamiliar 5-4-1 formation, leaving the tireless Toby Long up front by himself.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/1112salavhibs2.jpg" alt="" height="191" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">Guido is well-known for his relentless attack on the ball, his astute tacticts and his ability to lead by example but he is also an excellent motivational speaker.&nbsp; This week his pre-match speech contained a barage of bad language, inspiring his troops who came out hungry for victory from the word go.&nbsp; Lenny was the one exception, however.&nbsp; Taking offence to such vulgarities he decided to start on the bench allowing Aussie teen-sensation Peter to take his place on the left side of midfield.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Hibs had most of the early possesion and were camped inside Sala`s half for most of the first half but the Sala defense led by tough-tackling Brian Gallagher and shrewd Columbian Andres soaked up most of the pressure.&nbsp; Guido, playing the sweeper role to perfection, mopped up whatever else got through.&nbsp; Toby battled hard, chasing down every ball, and even drew a save from the keeper on one of the rare occasions Sala ventured deep into Hibs` half.&nbsp; Hibs` possesion eventually paid off as they found the breakthrough after about half an hour.&nbsp; After some good build-up substitute Steve Morris controlled the ball well on the edge of the box and fired a shot that keeper Sid Lloyd got a hand to but could only parry into the net.&nbsp; The big man made up for it five minutes later coming off his line to deny a Hibs striker who had been put clean through on goal.&nbsp; It was an&nbsp;crucial save meaning that at 1-0 down at half time Sala were still in the game.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/1112salavhibs3.jpg" alt="" height="208" width="242" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">It was decided that the 100 knot gale blowing across the park was slightly in Sala`s favour in the second half and with this in mind Guido switched to a 4-4-2,&nbsp;Bedingfield coming on to partner Toby in attack.&nbsp; The second half took on a different complexion with Sala gradually gaining the ascendancy in midfield.&nbsp; This was helped by the belated appearance of Shigeru who found plenty of space in the middle.&nbsp; Toby had the chance to equalize after being put through by a Bedingfield header but just pulled his volley wide.&nbsp; The two linked up again minutes later and this time Toby`s header grazed the cross bar.&nbsp; By this time Sala were enjoying most of the possesion.&nbsp; Hibs forays forward were negated by the everpresent Yusuke at the back and defense was being turned into attack.&nbsp; A series of Brookie corners finally led to the equalizer.&nbsp; One such corner was cleared initially by the Hibs defensive but&nbsp;Brookie&nbsp;floated in another cross to the backpost finding Bedingfield who headed home with relative ease.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									At 1-1 it was Sala who looked more capable of picking up the three points.&nbsp; Brookie received the ball in acres of space inside the box and probably had too much time to find his target, hitting the ball straight at the keeper.&nbsp; Andres fired over the bar from outside the box and Toby, who might`ve had a hatrick on another day, volleyed over the bar from the edge of the six yard box.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end Sala had to settle for a well-earned point.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Guido continued his tirade of expletives after the match, urging his players to&nbsp;maintain this kind of form&nbsp;through the busy pre-Christmas schedule.&nbsp; Everyone left the ground inspired and invigorated after this rare outburst of crudeness.&nbsp; Everyone, that is, but Lenny who left Misato thoroughly disgusted.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>

									Man of the Match:&nbsp; Yusuke.&nbsp; Turning into a fine centre half.&nbsp; Special mentions to Toby and Andres who battled hard all day in difficult conditions.<br>
