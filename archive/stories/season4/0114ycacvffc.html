The speed and movement of their forwards caused a few flutters in the heart of the YCAC defence and Gary the Goalie rode his luck at times.<br>
										<br>
										France eventually managed to score the 1st goal Gary has conceded in the last 5 1/2 League games. Unfortunately for them the home team was 3 goals up by then and finally ran out 4-1 winners.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										YCAC were somewhat grateful to turn round at 0-0 although were beginning to get the upper hand in the last 10 minutes of the half. Tim Miller settled the nerves immediately after the interval with a thumping header from Phil Denhams corner. 1-0 to the YCAC and those on the sideline began the usual nailbiting wait to see if their heroes could hold out or even grab a 2nd near the end. Astoundingly a scrambled effort from James Absolom followed by a debut goal for Matthew Wallace put YCAC in completely unchartered territory. 3 goals to the good for the 1st time in TML 4.<br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/07/0114ycacvffc3.jpg" alt="" height="219" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">I cant remember which but 1 of those goals was&nbsp;laid on&nbsp;by a beautiful cross from Nick McDonald, a really top bloke and great left back. Nick runs <b>Instinet</b> whose sponsorship of YCAC1 is up soon.&nbsp; <b>Instinet</b> is a global agency broker founded in 1969, and a damn fine one. One of the best, if not the best one founded that year. Nick McDonald; what a guy.<br>
										<br>
										After the French riposte, Neil Shonhard, also making his debut, added a 4th with a cheeky lob. 4 goals! YCAC hasnt scored 4 against Div1 opposition since, er, the last time France were the opponents at the arse end of last season. A warning for the Hibs and the rest of the pack chasing them or YCAC using up its goal quota for the next 3 games? We shall see next sunday when the Swiss are in town.<br>
