									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 4th Feb. </b>YCAC went nap against bottom of the table Jetro to edge back alongside BFC at the top of Division 1 on sunday<br>
										<br>
										All credit to Jetro who, despite their desperate situation, had a full squad out and fought keenly for the whole 80 minutes in the warm sunday afternoon sunshine. Ultimately, though they played some neat football through the midfield, they had neither the firepower up front nor the pace at the back to cope with the home team. In truth only an inspired performance from the goalkeeper saved the visitors from a much worse mauling.<br>
										<br>
										This was a potential banana skin avoided for the would be title challengers. Surely Jetro would get at least a point from someone sometime soon and with most of its 1st choice defence out, a repeat of last weeks reluctance in front of goal might mean a very long afternoon for the Yokohama faithful. Thankfully both him and his dog were&nbsp;spared the torment by the 1st half performance of Jamie Richards.&nbsp;Making his full home debut&nbsp;for the 1st team, Jamie scored twice in the opening half hour and also found time to pick out James Absolom with an exquisite chip which James headed home with aplomb.<br>
										<br>
										3-0 at HT and Jetros wait for their 1st points was already destined to last another week at least. Tyson Masar has had a lean time in front of goal of late and was determined to get in on the action. One typical run scything his way through the heart of Jetros defence was surely going to end in a great individual goal&nbsp;when&nbsp;he instead chose to lay the ball into the path of the onrushing Anthony Savage, obviously forgetting that the one time Grimsby trialist had already got his goal for the season. Anthony stunned friend and foe alike by smashing it 1st time with his right foot into the top corner. What a great goal that would have been if he had meant it and what embarrassment for those blokes outside the main bar directly behind the goal who had dropped babies to the floor, desperately protecting their beers, when they saw Anthony bear down<br>
										<br>
										Anthony's more normal role is that of provider and he got the chance to repay Tyson with a pin point free kick which&nbsp;was&nbsp;gleefully headed home for the fifth and final goal. 5-0 and YCACs best result for 2 seasons. If Jetro are going to make the charge to save themselves, they'll have to start soon. Unlikely maybe but I hope at least they dont end the season completely pointless, especially if they nick one from one of the other 4 teams in the log jam at the top of the table.<br>
