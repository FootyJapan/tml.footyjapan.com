								<p><b>OiFuto 1, Sat 16th Sept.</b> This matchup is filled with history, unfortunately not much was added to that with a ho-hum 0-0 draw on Saturday at Oifuto.&nbsp; Both teams had their defenses ready to play thus few quality chances were created and the keepers dealt pretty easily with shots from distance. &nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The BFC are a stronger side than last year with some speed at the back and a young Japanese midfielder capable of bursting through the midfield &#150; he is also capable of tumbling and doing the death roll when merely within shouting distance of an opposing player but you have to give credit to a player who takes people on (especially in the TML).&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									The Swiss probably had their strongest side out so far this year but they were unable to break down a solid BFC back four.&nbsp; Shots from midfield by Shio and Dave looked good but didn&rsquo;t trouble the tall man between the posts (I think they call him Lurky? &#150; I wished Sid would have been there today:-). &nbsp;Kai, Yan, and Yuji offered some speedier options but the passes in the final third were cut off or were just lacking in quality due to misunderstandings.&nbsp; The Swiss clearly need to play more together to create something against the stronger teams &#150; just showing up with the same old strategy doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									It was a solid game with some nice passing at times but neither team really threatened.&nbsp; The best chance of the game fell to the BFC&rsquo;s young Japanese player whose shot just went over the left hand corner with about 15 minutes to go in the 2H.&nbsp; <br>
									For the Swiss &#150; another solid game by Cho, Raffa, and Koi while Shio looked good, great stand-in keeping by Uchida as well.&nbsp; Coming out of the back &#150; the Swiss move it around nicely and are comfortable with the ball &#150; connecting with the forwards remains an issue that lacks an obvious solution at this point.&nbsp; In spite of the troubles &#150; the Swiss move to the top of the league table for the first time in a year, good to see that order has been restored!<br>
