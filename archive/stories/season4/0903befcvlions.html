								<p><b>Misato, Sun 3rd Sept.</b> Incredible as it may seem to anyone who witnessed&nbsp;BEFC's struggles in 2005, when they&nbsp;shipped so many goals that the referee had to put an assistant with one of those little&nbsp;thumb-operated click-counters by the&nbsp;Embassy goal&nbsp;just to keep&nbsp;score, the&nbsp;Reds finished TML3 strong, going undefeated in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;A few&nbsp;friendlies against soft opposition kept the streak going through the summer months.&nbsp; But could it last into the&nbsp;new season?&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially against&nbsp;TML newcomers, the&nbsp;- presumably hungry -Lions?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/0903befclions2.jpg" alt="" height="197" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">As-yet-undefeated BEFC captain Tim Letheren, perhaps sensing&nbsp;this could be the day his &quot;Scouse Zen&quot;&nbsp;magic&nbsp;finally wore thin, was absent, so Fernando &quot;Peron&quot;&nbsp;  Bermudez&nbsp;took the helm.&nbsp;&nbsp; An Argentinian captaining the British Embassy?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lions must have fancied their chances.&nbsp; Especially as the&nbsp;AVERAGE age of&nbsp;the BEFC&nbsp;back 5 at kick-off was - wait for it - 43 (forty-three).&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that&nbsp;2006&nbsp;red&nbsp;is mature and full-bodied, all right.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Lions&nbsp;certainly showed intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight from the kick-off,&nbsp;Abubakar Birkia - a man who clearly has&nbsp;skills to burn - dribbled past three BEFC players before putting a 40-yard lob attempt over the crossbar by 12 inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, however, BEFC settled into a rather comfortable groove.&nbsp; Lots of&nbsp;passing, calm defence from the uber-veterans Sendo, Keith,&nbsp;Gary and Ryan,&nbsp;and strength and pace up front from Steve &quot;Crouchie&quot; Lidbury and new-boy Eddie.&nbsp; An accurate cross from the left by&nbsp;Biffa Bacon, he of&nbsp;the cultured left foot  (well, one part of him has to be), half-cleared by&nbsp;Lions, and&nbsp;a neat finish from Eddie: 1-0.&nbsp; Then an incisive ball down the right&nbsp;freed Kotaro,&nbsp;whose first time cross (yes,&nbsp;you read it right:&nbsp;&quot;first time cross&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;Kotaro&quot; in the same sentence)&nbsp;was blocked by a Lions'&nbsp;paw.&nbsp; A&nbsp;whack-it-straight-down-the-middle-and-hope-the-keeper-dives-out-of-the-way-oh-good-he-has-done&nbsp;penalty from Steve made it&nbsp;2-0.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Then the inevitable BEFC wobble.&nbsp; Out with the&nbsp;football, in with&nbsp;the hack-and-hoof which served&nbsp;them&nbsp;so poorly in&nbsp;Division 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lions pushed forward and earned a debatable penalty as Fernando raised his arm to protect his face from a free-kick.&nbsp; Omar smartly sent the keeper&nbsp;the wrong way to get Lions right back in it, 2-1.&nbsp; At half-time, BEFC trudged to the sidelines, bickering, while their captain busied&nbsp;himself  debating the&nbsp;ball-to-hand, hand-to-ball law with&nbsp;unimpressed ref Quentin.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/0903befclions5.jpg" alt="" height="211" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">The second half was a typical competitive&nbsp;game of Division 2 football between two fairly evenly-matched teams.&nbsp; Lions pushed and probed but&nbsp;- credit to a hard-working BEFC defence - never&nbsp;managed a shot on goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only drama in the BEFC area was predictably left to&nbsp;keeper Lever, whose retaliation after an&nbsp;aerial foul&nbsp;earned&nbsp;a&nbsp;- possibly charitable - yellow card.&nbsp;&nbsp;Takashi's superb cameo down the&nbsp;left side and Taka's hard work in the middle helped BEFC&nbsp;to get over their bad patch and&nbsp;finish&nbsp; strongly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouchie rattled the bar from a beautiful whipped-in cross&nbsp;by Andy &quot;temper temper&quot; Drought, then&nbsp;ten minutes later, Biffa's half-blocked shot found its way to Andy, who thumped it away with&nbsp;the last kick of the game.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Verdict: new season,&nbsp;sun,&nbsp;a good grass pitch,&nbsp;an excellent ref: hey, what's not to like?&nbsp;&nbsp;BEFC - who had a few key players missing today -&nbsp;might just&nbsp;enjoy their TML4 campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as they remember that football seasons and calendar years aren't the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Lions, this must have been a&nbsp;tough introduction to&nbsp;Division 2, but they look like a team with enough quality to do more than just survive.<br>
