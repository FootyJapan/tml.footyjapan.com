Though all of depleted squad of bare 11 who showed up played quite well, even created some chances and came close to scoring a goal, BFC were the ones who played with more motivation and determinations throughout.<br>
										It was a one of those nights..... Just losing 6 key regular players meant no subs for Hibs. A Large Hachioji park and facing a much improved BFC,  turned out to be a recipe for trouble.<br>
										5 munites into the match BFC marksman Jon Day executed a great first timer from a 45 degree angle. From then on, both sides worked hard to claim  control in the middle of the park. Into the second half BFC Finnish keeper Jurki went out to a non-contact injury putting Al Himmer&nbsp;between the posts, which may have turned unfortunate for  Hibs as striker Tomo Kinii's shots were athletically stopped on a few occasions by th 6 foot 6&nbsp;giant.&nbsp;<br>
										With 20 munites to go, Hibs went on to push Defender Jay Alabaster forward, but putting 7 men in attack to recover the deficit tured costly. BFC Shosuke Yamagishi and James Morson capitalized on 2 tired Hibs defenders out for a footrace and scored appropriately.<br>
										Credit to Hibs men for never giving up, specially excellent&nbsp;efforts from Mick O'hagan and Atsushi Yamaguchi upfront.<br>
										The battle continues on for 9 more league matches as Hibs will try to rise from ashes for&nbsp;its title run.<br>
