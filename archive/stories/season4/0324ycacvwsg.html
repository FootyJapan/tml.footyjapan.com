									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 24th March</b>, If its true that great sides find a way to win while playing badly then YCAC are&nbsp;the Hungary of the 50s, Spurs circa 1961 and&nbsp;Liverpool of the 70s all rolled into one if still somewhat short of the 1976/77 Camberley Town Youth team. They, YCAC that is,&nbsp;managed to beat WSG 4-1 on Sunday despite playing possibly their worst 40 minutes of this season and probably quite a few gone by too. The Geckoes were not alone&nbsp;in wondering just how they managed to be losing 2-1 as they trooped off for the intermission after playing, at least at times, YCAC off the park in the 1st period.<br>
										<br>
										Prematch showers bedded&nbsp;the YCAC DustBowl down nicely and even flattened a few of the&nbsp;bumps leaving a fast greasy surface. Unfortunately a good 2/3 of the surface has no grass left and a little rain turns the dirt soft and tacky. Great for slide tackles but not so for ones footholding as the dirt sticks between&nbsp;studs and renders ones Y20,000 Predators as functional as a pair of old Green Flash<br>
										<br>
										WSG made the most of defenders discomfort on their feet by running aggressively at them and playing the ball in behind the back 4 keeping them constantly on the turn. Mikkel and, in particular, Kazu caused numerous difficulties through their direct running. YCACs approach was a little more direct but, ultimately, more successful. Even during the 1H horror show the home side still managed to get the ball into the final 1/3 more than did the visitors. Both sets of defenders had days to forget. The difference was that most of the Geckoes discomfort was experienced in their own penalty area whereas YCAC did most of their floundering further up the pitch in less dangerous postcodes<br>
										<br>
										The 1st 2 goals, one each, were both obvious examples on how to score goals in the difficult conditions. (1) Neil Shonnard hits the ball hard along the ground on target. It picks up speed off the wet surface and fizzes past the GK. 1-0 YCAC. (2)&nbsp;A Geckoe dinks the ball into the area from&nbsp; a freekick forcing the defender to have to turn to clear. He ends up on his arse and Kazu drives the&nbsp;ball under the GK. 1-1<br>
										<br>
										As well as the Geckoes had played and continued to play its difficult to think of another instance of them causing Koka, the YCAC Keeper, any discomfort with a direct shot. Plenty of pressure including a barrage of corners in the 2H but, again, neat approach work tended to fall away in the final 25 yds or was rebuffed by&nbsp;a YCAC back 4 gaining marginally in confidence as the game progressed.<br>
										<br>
										Jamie Richards predatory 1H goal had been responsible for the slender lead and the game remained in the balance until about 15 minutes to go when Neil Shonnard smashed one into the roof of the net from an acute angle. His 4th of the season and YCAC finally has someone on the front page of the TML website. Big Neil missed his hattrick by inches late on as he collided with the even larger Geckoes Keeper chasing a through ball. The ball ran loose, however, and Joe Takeda drove it expertly back into the net from 20 yards past the out of position goalie and his helpless defence<br>
										<br>
										4-1 and on the balance of play the Geckoes can feel hard done by. In terms of clear cut chances, however, as measured by the patented Cows Arse Banjo ratio, the margin of victory could have been a lot wider. Lucky or not, YCAC nick 1st place from the idle British and get to spend a whole week at least with the rest of League looking up its skirt. <br>
