								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 5th Nov.</b> As always the TML Division 2 is proving somethig of a challenge for YCAC2 this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the standard of teams is generally improving and there is no such thing as an easy 3 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly how it should be!<br>
									<br>
									We went into this game having had 2 straight defeats - one to AFC (who never used to beat anybody!) and one to a revitalised Vagabonds team (with a few BFC ringers in it).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also missing a few players in midfield due to work commitments, plus Lions were an unknown quantity who had done Shane 5-2 in their last outing.<br>
									<br>
									A fairly even first half finally swung the Lions way with one of the now traditional defensive mistakes that we've been perfecting for some time in the Seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair I don't remember us troubling their keeper much that half, it was mostly played in our half due to the also-traditional breeze blowing straight down  the pitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lions had come close a few times.<br>
									<br>
									Second half had barely kicked off when Viv (first game back and looking very comfortable) slotted a great ball through to Tom on the left.&nbsp;&nbsp;He rounded the fullback and then knocked over a cracking cross which caused confusion in the Lions defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't see who scored but it wasn't one of our players.&nbsp;&nbsp;1-1 and game on.&nbsp;&nbsp; We probably played our best football from this point onwards - Alex in particular was running his socks off in midfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember thinking we could do this.....and then almost immediately another bit of messy play let to Lions taking the lead once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Still cometh the hour, cometh the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;Per took responsibility for a free kick with 5 minutes left - must have been 30 meters out - and absolutely buried in in the top left hand corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;A smashing goal at any level.<br>
									<br>
									A good match which was very ably refereed.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Best wishes to Rob O`Grady for a speedy recovery.&nbsp; (Rob is currently being investigated by the Union of Centre Halves for being stretchered off the field and taking an ambulance to hospital.)<br>
