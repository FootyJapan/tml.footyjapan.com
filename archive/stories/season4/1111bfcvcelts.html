								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 11th Nov.</b> Four different scorers found the net as BFC hit back from 1-0 down at half-time with a trouser-bursting second-half performance against the Kanto Celts on Saturday. The Eggman poached (eh, Jerry?!) a deserved equaliser at the start of the second half after Jon Day's shot was well blocked by the Celts goalkeeper.<br>
									Shosuke should have equalised moments after the restart but, having done the hard part by skinning two defenders, he blasted his shot wide from six yards out. Not to worry.<br>
									Egg's fifth of the season proved the catalyst for BFC's comeback after having gone into the break 1-0 down. An early goal from a rare Celts raid on Big Jyrki's penalty area gave BFC a wake-up call but, apart from one golden chance squandered by Shosuke, there was little end product from the men in blue.<br>
									But after Evans had restored parity, BFC decided to stop arsing about and play some football, resulting in arguably their best 40 minutes of the season.<br>
									New recruit Satoshi gave BFC the advantage with a sharp finish from just inside the box before Brian arrived like Thomas the Tank Engine on steroids to ram home a corner from Evans from about six inches.<br>
									The step-over (or air-shot, depending on your line of vision or willingness to be charitable) by someone in a blue shirt at the near post fooled everybody. But you would have to get up pretty early in the morning to fool the 'Engine'. 3-1 and BFC were cruising. It's not often you can say that, but they really were. Hoorah!<br>
									To be fair to the Celts, they had kept BFC's back four on their toes, although Jyrki really had little to do but think about Sunday's official lunch for the former Finnish Prime Minister. Pear chicken on the menu at the Finnish Embassy tomorrow, if anyone's interested.<br>
									James had an enormous game for BFC. The little fella was literally everywhere, covering every blade of fake plastic grass and generally giving it loads. Triffic stuff. Leigh Manson reinvented himself as a left winger, although he humbly refused the temptation to pull the trigger from distance on one foray up the park, doubtless due to the nosebleed.<br>
									Dr. Phil, fully recovered from eye surgery in a dodgy back-street surgery on Friday night, put it another solid shift, apart from one moment of utter madness (probably caused by a momentary loss of vision), which was quickly snuffed out by James.<br>
									Enough of the defenders, though. It was one-way traffic after Brian's goal. BFC capped a fine second half with their best goal of the season -- shifting the ball from one end of the pitch to the other with the speed of Stan Collymore in a public carpark.<br>
									Jon Day released Neil with a ridiculous cross-field ball from right to left that would have had anyone daft enough to watch a TML game in the rain ooh-ing and aah-ing. The Little Pink One skipped inside and rolled the ball into the path of Paul, who smashed the ball first-time into the top corner from 25 yards. And with his right-foot, hitherto used only for standing and pogo dancing. Creme de la menthe.<br>
									BFC could have added to their tally, Neil attempting to curl one into the top corner and Jon Best close to connecting after a flick-on from Alastair, who himself missed the target with a late header. But in the end it was all 'oeuf sur la plat' for BFC in their bid to stay in touch with TML leaders Hibs.<br>
