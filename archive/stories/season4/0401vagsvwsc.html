									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 1st April</b>, Paul Wadsworth wont be playing but Steve G will was like the Irish Limerick &ldquo; there is only one bar but it's a mile long&rdquo;. You could write a novella about this game if you were that way inclined. The stakes were high and are worth reiterating: lose, no promotion. Win, chance of promotion. Add significance according to your constitution. <br>
										<br>
										Here`s the funny thing. Wall Street Clash were a good team &#150; in the sense that they played as a team, with no stars or weak links, just a decent team who happened to lose today 6-1. <br>
										Vagabonds, however, were sublime. I defy any observer, and we had a few today (from overseas) to claim otherwise. A plague of devastation infested the pitch within 10 minutes that would surely bring a bead of moisture of the lacrimal glands of anyone who has ever dragged a vagabond jersey over his head since the team was inaugurated in 1999.<br>
										<br>
										In a game of this importance and intensity myth and reality are bound to entangle but here are the basic facts: Neil crossed to Simon from 30 yards or so and the mild-mannered gent buried the first goal. Muzzy scored the second and Alex scored the next four. WSC nabbed a consolation goal in the dying minutes from a decent strike, deflected off Gary`s bloodied knee.<br>
										<br>
										At half time it was 3-0. Not much to say except keep it up. Second half we had a gorgeous view of the cherry blossoms behind hajioji park until it grew dark about 20 minutes later. In Japan it grows dark alarmingly fast. In the west of Ireland, by contrast, twilight can last nearly and hour in spring and summer. <br>
										<br>
										It is worth rating players today according to their performance vis-&agrave;-vis their ability but I wont because if I did the ratings would be unbelievable to anyone who didn't see the game. <br>
										However the outstanding highlights of todays game were the passing &#150; both short and long. The finishing speaks for itself.<br>
										<br>
										Sharing a taxi back to the station with a few WSC players was a challenge. While I chatted to these decent fellows I had to keep elbowing Alex Sahara in the ribs as he attempted self-mortification over only scoring 4 goals. Another funny thing: we warmed up today like a serious team and started the game with a palpable confidence that put everybody at ease &#150; not imagining a 6-1 scoreline perhaps &#150; but sure of a blistering account of ourselves.<br>
										<br>
										After the game, in the egg shop, we gathered for a scrutiny of the personalities that played this season. A shoddy bunch for sure. Simon extracted his attractive sister and her friend pronto, while Maz was april fooled by his almost ready to deliver wife. Lyndsey Hughes was man of the match today  - although its been brewing for a few games now &#150; notwithstanding Alex`s multiplicity of goals and 6 other man-of-the-match candidates whom I wont mention.<br>
										<br>
										Nori stayed a bit longer, fetching bottles of Kirin with her lovely smile and more gyoza for Muzzy, until finally there was but a knot of poets and pedants left to muse on the season and the future of the BFC Vagabonds. Adrian with a mini shiraz and Beaujolais stolen from British Airways, the rest of us on a diet of Hops (suntory) and American Spirit cigarettes (no chemicals). <br>
										<br>
										The final analysis of the spirit of the vagabonds remained open for discussion.<br>
