								<p><b>St Mary's, Sat 9th Sept.</b> Well this was indeed 'one of those days' for the Hibs. Not in the way we played, but more the way we performed in front of goal.<br>
									The Hibs v Swiss is always a special game for the Hibs. The Swiss always have a good quality team, have a long and proud history in Tokyo and I have been on the hands of so many defeats too them that victory feels especially sweet. <br>
									<br>
									After our 5-1 victory over them 12 months ago our roles had been reversed, with the Hibs playing the role of defending champs that are begging to be knocked off their pedestal and the Swiss gunning to regain their lost TML crown.<br>
									We almost got away to a great start when the ball skipped through from some corner scraps to Bevan who could not get enough on it to get it over the line and Peter Pauli got both hands on the ball with resting on the goal line. We continued to press the Swiss defense throughout the first half, but the Swiss were defending ably and seemed to have 7 or 8 guys behind the ball every time we moved forward. Just before half time sharp work from Tomo released Yohei on the left, who beat his man on the bye line inside the box and rolled it beyond Peter P across the goal to find Yama in front of the goal with no-one within coo-ee (Australian for a long way). Uncharacteristically Yama double snatched at it and put it over the bar. The Swiss actually had more shots on target in the first half, thanks solely to Dave Pratt who seemed to be on a Frank Lampard-esque world cup mission - receive the ball and shoot no matter what was happening. Unfortunately for the Hibs and Hitoshi, Dave P's shots carried far more accuracy and danger than Lampard's motley world cup selection and only some athletic saves from Hitoshi kept them out.<br>
									<br>
									0-0 into half time and we felt a tad unlucky, but worse was to come. The smaller Swiss squad began to tire in the heat and wave after wave of Hibernian attack continued to look like finally bearing fruit. Poor Hibs decision making and desperate defending by the Swiss kept the scores even. The Hibs had two excellent chances in the last 5 minutes to grab the winner but Bevan snatched at his shot and Mick mis-timed his header to see the game finish at 0-0. The best on the field for the Hibs were Jay, Ike, Yohei Tomo and Mick. We cannot be disappointed with the way we played, and can hold our heads up high. I think we used up all our luck against the Swiss in the 5-1 win last year as we've had none in our 3 games against them ever since. A week's rest and back on the job with an important game v the Geckoes on September 23. <b><br>Report &#150; Bevan Colless.</b><br>
