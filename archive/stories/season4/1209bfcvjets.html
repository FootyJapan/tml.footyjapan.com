									<p><b>Hanno, Sat 9th Dec.</b> ike Ronaldinho. Moments of genius like that you just can't put into words.' Having said that Evans spent the best part of the next seven hours describing in painstaking detail just how lost for words he was over his latest heroics.<br>
										Both BFC's goals had a touch of the spectacular, captain Jon looping a fierce right-foot shot over the JETs goalkeeper from 25 metres after Pink Neil had cleverly reversed the play from left to right. That it took BFC 30 minutes to break the deadlock had much to do with the quality of the final ball.<br>
										Needless fouls in dangerous areas gave the JETs a sniff of an equaliser on the stroke of halftime and a freak goal caught out Jyrky, who had brilliantly saved a near-post header earlier in the first half. Morson's blasted clearance ricocheted back off the JETs striker's knee and flew under Jyrky's body for a barely deserved equaliser.<br>
										The second half was one-way traffic as BFC surged forward but again the final ball was lacking. Shosuke took it upon himself to take on half the JETs team, who were reduced to hacking him down with monotonous regularity. Cynical perhaps but the boy is mustard.<br>
										JETs complained about their yellow card count (at least three) but there was little attempt to play the ball at times when challenging the Japanese winger. Shosuke himself was lucky not to see red at the end after kicking out Beckham-style after yet another lunge from behind but he escaped caution as well as shattered limbs before climbing back into his pinstripe suit.<br>
										BFC's winner came with 15 minutes left, Jon twisting and turning to find space on the left and cutting back onto his right foot to ping it into the mixer as the strikers took it upon themselves to provide their own crosses.<br>
										Evans had a bit to do but swivelled into his best Muse limbo-dancing pose circa 2002 to hook the ball in off the post. Cue stunned silence. To be fair he now has two of the BFC's top three goals of the season -- the other his miscued cross (sorry: thunderous shot) at YCAC.<br>
										Saturday's game was the last in BFC colours for Jon 'Wardrobe' Best, who again proved himself to be the hostess with the mostest by providing hot showers for the boys at his Ebisu shag-pad (although his offer of rubdowns all round precipated a wild stampede for the exit).<br>
										As a special treat the Bobby Davro lookalike wore his chequered inside-out tank top to the pub. Pure nostalgia. It was emotional.<br>
										Three deserved points in BFC's last fixture before the Christmas Binge left them second, two points behind champions Hibs, and in trouser-burstingly good fettle for 2007. Apres moi la deluge, Rodders.<br>
