					<h1 class="red">Hibs Finish Season with a Flurry of Goals</h1>
					<p><b>Todoroki, Sunday 27th May</b>, With a victory in their final game of the season the Hibs had the chance to leap-frog a couple of perennial mid table teams (whose names escape me at the moment) and relieve them of the vertigo that they had no doubt been suffering from, before the condition became permanent. This could have had dire consequences with known side effects too numerous to mention. France FC had motivations of their own as they were embroiled in a relegation battle and for a club with a proud history they had a lot to play for. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0527hibsvffc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<h1 class="navy">BFC WIN LEAGUE BY 6-POINTS</h1>
					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 26th May</b>,<br>
						<br>
						Newly crowned TML champions BFC finished their season with a 4-0 victory over Kanto Celts, skipper Jon Day scoring twice as we finished six points ahead of second-placed Swiss Kickers.<br>
						It was 0-0 at halftime too -- a common theme in BFC-Celts games. That all changed with two goals inside a minute at the start of the second half through Jon and young Alex Sahara.<br>

					<h1 class="red">Down Without a Fight</h1>
					<p><b>Fuchu no mori, Saturday 26th May</b>, Jetro FC sent themselves down to Division 2 without a shot being fired late Friday night, when they decided to cancel their Saturday fixture with Sala. The 3-0 forfeit win left Sala poised at 3rd awaiting Hibs final result but the -1pt forfeit meant, regardless of their final result against Celts, thet Jetro would be unable to rise from the bottom of Division 1. This now leaves 3 teams on 13 points and all having to play each other to find out who is the other team for the chop.<br>

						&nbsp;<br>
						Well, for Shane FC, the answer to the late great Doc's question was &quot;just 90 minutes more&quot; as they came to Yoyogi Park in search of one last victory to add a little respectability to a season which, according to the table, they would mostly like to forget.&nbsp; Their opponents, Stoneds, also suffered a below par season, and in the light of the FA Cup Final, nobody in attendence was expecting a masterclass in the sweltering Tokyo heat.<br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 13th May</b>, With all the razzmatazz and fanfare of the Premiership relegation games, the Kanto Celts arrived at Misato ASG on a warm Sunday afternoon ready to take on France FC in a game which could make all the difference in who stays in the top flight of the TML and who goes down.<br>

					<h1 class="navy">French Get a Swiss Lesson.</h1>
					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 6th May</b>, A very English day met the Swiss as they were to round out the season, rain and a chilly breeze at Saitama Stadium (well, Hachioji Koen) for their final match of the '06-'07 campaign.&nbsp; Hopes of sneaking the title from the British on goal difference were dashed the day before with Sala being well beaten&nbsp;by the BFC, allowing them&nbsp;to claim the championship with a match in hand - well done to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the strongest throughout the year, consistent recruiting on the part of management meant that player turnover and inavailability were mere speed bumps as they raced to the title. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0506swissvffc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						<br>
						A change has come for BFC and it&rsquo;s been a long time coming indeed, more than a decade according to some scholars, but BFC have won the league, not that TML has been running for a decade, but BFC outdates TML by a fair few years&#x2026; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0505bfcvsala1.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 5th May</b>, Sala handed BFC their first TML title after being outplayed by the champions at Hachioji on Saturday.<br>
						<br>
						BFC scored three times in the first half to virtually kill the game, and the second half was played out as something of a formality.<br>
						<br>
						Sala started brightly enough and indeed could have taken the lead when Toby&rsquo;s goal bound strike was blocked by a defender with the keeper floundering on the ground. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0505bfcvsala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>OiFuto, Saturday 5th May</b>, We went into our 2nd last match of the season with position on the ladder the only goal to aim for, our season that began with a bang and had been finishing with a whimper. Despite going out of the cup and falling out of the running for the league several weeks before, perhaps we could muster enough talent to see our way past bottom placed Jetro in our second last match of the year.<br>
						Perhaps not. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/0505hibsvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
