									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 17th March</b>, Sala kept up the pressure on the top two with a battling win in wind ravaged Saitama on Saturday, the game marking the end of Andres&rsquo; all too brief stay at the club.<br>
											What with veteran ankle biter Brian Gallagher off to Aichi this month, Sala are desperately lacking in midfield tenacity and Andres will be sadly missed. The player, who has turned out to be probably Columbia&rsquo;s second greatest export of all-time, did find time to mark the end of his tenure in the same way he started it though - by scoring a vital goal.<br>
											Unlike some teams in the TML who are as predictable as a Scottish summer, you always know what you are going to get with the JETs, a long hard physical battle, some decent verbal&rsquo;s and quite routinely another black mark in the &ldquo;goals against&rdquo; column. Check, check and check.<br>
											Sala captain and long term injury jockey, Wee Jock McGeisler, set out an experienced side &#150; wingers Lenny and Gilo with a combined age of 87 &#150; and left the youthful trio of Pete, Ian and Yusuke (Whose average age would leave them struggling to gain entry to licensed premises) on the bench.<br>
											Cue another roaring speech from Clarkey, the almost mandatory piss poor performance in the first five minutes and finally Sala joined the game.<br>
											The JETs had the better of the opening quarter, creating a few half chances but were never really able to trouble Sid. This profligacy cost them dearly when Sala took the lead after twenty minutes.<br>
											A rash tackle from a JETs midfielder, saw Shigeru take a quick free kick. The referee expressly gave permission for the kick to be taken, but was still talking to the JETs players as Shige squared the ball to Doug Lee. His chip forward was flicked on by Charles to Toby, and he squared the ball to Shige who had come hurtling through the middle. Once clear of the last man, the outcome was inevitable and Mr. Chino&rsquo;s well placed shot left the keeper no chance. 1v0. JETs players complained long and hard about the taking of the free-kick and will no doubt feel hard done by, so it&rsquo;s just as well that this goal was not to decide the game.<br>
											Sala, still with the wind at their backs, failed to take advantage of it for the rest of the half and created very little in the final third.<br>
											Dan&rsquo;s quick throw unleashed Scotty down the left and his excellent cross was nearly headed in at the near post by the diving Giles, but a blue shirt blocked well. The half ended with a bit more Sala pressure, but no more extra work for the JET&rsquo;s keeper.<br>
											The second half was thankfully a bit better by both teams. Sala, one nil up, looked content to keep the ball around the half way line without pushing for a killer second, and eventually JETs pounced.<br>
											A rather hopeful, bullet like pass, somehow squeezed between ten sets of legs in the midfield and emerged as a well paced through ball, which utterly deceived Clarkey and Ian at the back. Ian appeared to be running in jelly as he chased it down, presuming that Clarkey would cover it. Clarkey obviously thought the same thing and JETs dynamo Sasaki gleefully accepted the gift before drilling it low and hard past Sid, who got a touch on it but couldn&rsquo;t keep it out. 1v1.<br>
											But cometh the hour, cometh the Columbian, Andres soon had Sala back in the driving seat.<br>
											After conceding the goal and listening to a few rants from Scotty and Clarkey apropos the state of our season if the game should end in a draw, Sala changed up a gear and finally started playing some football.<br>
											After neat build up from Pete and Shigeru, Scotty played in Giles down the right. His cross was inch perfect for Toby who tried to connect with a back heel, through the legs style dink from three yards out, or as he called it later &lsquo;a dummy&rsquo;, and the ball came through for Andres to power home a left footed shot from a tight angle at the back stick.2v1.<br>
											JETs were by no means out of it though, and there were several nervy moments at the back for Sala to endure. Indeed the defence deserve a huge slice of the credit for this result, unfortunately they aren&rsquo;t going to get any in this report though. In the end it was neat, first time passing in the midfield that opened up the JETs defence once more.<br>
											Starting again with Peter, Shigeru and this time Yusuke, the ball was moved down the right flank. Memory fails as to the exact happenings but the keeper was beaten (by Giles?) and the ball rolled agonizingly along the goaline, only for someone to hit it back along the line the other way. Finally when the ball arrived at Toby&rsquo;s feet he had the composure to look up and square it past the by now recovered goalie to Scott, who tapped into the empty net from a yard out. 3v1. Goal of the season it was not, but it capped a fine display from the Scottish midfielder. On the touchline McGeisler breathed a very audible sigh of relief and celebrated alongside fellow injury jockey Bedingfield, who turned up drunk with the sole intention of getting himself in the match report. Thankfully I can see to it that that will not be happening&#x2026;<br>
											So, so long Mr. Munera, you will be missed like a longtime family pet gone to live on &lsquo;a farm&rsquo; in the countryside. Your legacy of bamboozling goals will be all that remains (And the lumps missing from opposing midfielders legs of course!).<br>
											Another result dug from hard earth by Sala, but still more challenges await in the form of Hibs, BFC and Swiss..<br>
