									<p><b>Hodogaya, Saturday 17th March</b>, The first snow of the year had to be at 9 am on Saturday in Hodogaya, 15 minutes before kick-off between Jetro and the Swiss.&nbsp; Both teams were suffering from the time/location penalty imposed by the league, one of the Swiss players had to get up at 4 am while Jetro only started with 10 grim looking souls.&nbsp; With the way the Swiss have been playing recently, any advantage was appreciated and they jumped on top quickly.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jetro was trying to play with 3 across the back but there were openings galore. &nbsp;The first 20 minutes were all Swiss as a little pressure produced easy chances. &nbsp;The first goal came from a nice through ball to Kirk which resulted in a 1 on 1 vs. the keeper.&nbsp; He was back pedaling and didn&rsquo;t know where he was, giving Kirk enough time to find a smooth patch on the beach to knock it in for a 1-0 lead on 10 minutes.&nbsp; There were a couple of more chances like that in a short amount of time with Yuji blasting at the keeper and another 1 on 1 missed.&nbsp; Fortunately, before Jetro&rsquo;s 11th player arrived, Aoki produced a beautiful pass over the side back for Kirk to control and knock past the keeper into the lower left corner.&nbsp; 2-0 on 20 minutes and that is the way it would finish. &nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The ground didn&rsquo;t allow for much quality in terms of the footy played.&nbsp; Jetro&rsquo;s play did improve once their bulky forward showed up and he held the ball up well.&nbsp; He did nearly get away for a 1 on 1 in the 2H but Raffa caught him just outside the box and he blasted the free kick wide.&nbsp; The Swiss did have a couple more opportunities with Aoki blasting straight at the keeper after some nice build up and Karl had a nice volley tipped wide in the final 5 minutes.&nbsp; Luckily for the Swiss, we&rsquo;ve made it through a tough weekend in terms of player availability and look forward to a week off before our next encounter with the Celts.<br>
