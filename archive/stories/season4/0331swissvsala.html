Karl eventually got a shot off which Sid did well to block but it rebounded straight to Kai for him to smack into the upper left corner.&nbsp; Kirk had a chance to double the lead about 5 minutes later only to see his volley from 25 yards out fly over Sid and bounce off the bar. &nbsp;Another 5 minutes on, he didn&rsquo;t miss with his head after a perfect corner by Aoki, getting away from Paul Clarke to head it straight into the left hand corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/07/0331swissvsala3.jpg" alt="" height="231" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">The first half ended with Sala pushing hard but never really creating clear chances. &nbsp;Many of the balls to the corner were picked up but crosses were poor and there weren&rsquo;t enough attackers in the box to create problems for Raffa and Peter.&nbsp; Suzuki was working extremely hard on the left hand side and was up and down the field. &nbsp;The first half ended 2-0.&nbsp; One bad ending to the first half was the loss of our center back, Chris, due to a muscle pull but he was to be more than adequately replaced by Phillip.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half began similarly, the Swiss were doing a little better holding onto the ball but didn&rsquo;t create much up front.&nbsp; Sala got more balls into the attacking 3rd but really didn&rsquo;t pressure Peter until a few of the high balls got into to the 6 yard box.&nbsp; Guido made his presence felt and it did firm up the back line but the attackers weren&rsquo;t getting the ball in good positions to get good shots off. &nbsp;The Swiss would eventually get a 3rd goal with JP floating a free kick into Kirk at the top of the box, he held off Guido and dropped it to Kohama who got away from his defender and &lsquo;passed&rsquo; it by Sid into the lower left hand corner.&nbsp; It was a nice play worked together by 3 players who have been kicking it around for 10 years.&nbsp; The game would end 3-0 with few clear chances either way. &nbsp;For the Swiss, it is a nice way to head towards the end of the season with the BFC looking well clear at the top but there remains a battle for that last automatic Champions League qualifying spot &#150; all to play for&#x2026;.<br>
