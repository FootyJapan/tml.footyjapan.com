									<p><b>Oi Futo, Sunday 4th March</b>, Saitama Jets picked up their first TML points since October against a lackluster Swiss side at sunny Oi Futo.  Yoshi Osawa opened the scoring in the first half with a cool finish from inside the box and the Jets doubled their advantage early in the second half with a Nate Gildart penalty.  However the Swiss pulled one back immediately with a penalty of their own, awarded for handball, but despite late pressure there was to be no equalizer and the Jets held out for a valuable 3 points.<br>
										<br>
										Having become used to the perfect plastic at Yono&rsquo;s Hachioji Park the hard, uneven and dusty dirt surface at Oi Futo was something of a culture shock for the Jets.  The unseasonably warm Tokyo afternoon was also a stark contrast to the cold and dark Saitama evenings that the Jets generally play under, but the effects of the energy sapping sun were countered by effective substitutions as legs began to tire.  <br>
										The game started with the Jets pressing the Swiss back in the early exchanges without really creating anything.  Slowly the Swiss came into it more but still chances were few and far between, both sides finding it difficult to play decent football on the bobbly pitch, the ball bouncing around on occasions as if it had a will of its own.  As the Swiss started to put more attacking moves together captain Mark Eite, who had been drafted into the centre of defence and enjoyed an excellent game along with fellow centre-back Matt Turner, picked up a harsh early yellow for his first foul which the ref&rsquo; viewed as deliberate. <br>
										Saitama, as always, were working hard to close down the opposition, put pressure on the man with the ball, and to counter-attack whenever possible.  Gildart, having a standout game, was dropping off his marker to collect the ball, turn and attempt to feed strike partner Ryan Loren, whose pace troubled the Swiss backline all afternoon, whilst on the flanks Osawa and Sasaki ran tirelessly to cover their respective fullbacks and get forward to support the strikers whenever possible.  <br>
										The Swiss never really looked like scoring, indeed one Swiss forward came closer to putting a Jets defender into the net as he totally missed the ball and instead sent Hayashi out of the game with a wild swing that caught the right-back on the shin.  It was poor defending by the Jets, as they struggled to clear the ball, that gave the Swiss their best chance, but the shooter blazed over from 10 yards.  <br>
										The deadlock was broken 10 minutes before the break when Ryan Botta won the ball on the halfway line and surged into opposition territory holding off a couple of defenders to play it through to Gildart, who turned and laid a perfect ball into the path of right-winger Osawa, the Swiss defence had been breached and as the big &lsquo;keeper and a centre-back converged on the skinny Japanese he delicately lifted the ball into the goal to give the men from Saitama the lead.  1 &#150; 0 at half time.<br>
										<br>
										The second half began much as the first half had and the Jets were feeling quite comfortable, holding the Swiss attack at arms length and looking good on the counter.  Both Sasaki and Botta were given shooting opportunities as a result of Gildart&rsquo;s intelligent forward play, but neither could trouble the keeper.  A second goal for the Jets was looking increasingly likely and it was no surprise that it came courtesy of Loren&rsquo;s speed and determination.  The American striker, who been a willing runner all afternoon, hared onto a through ball, raced into the area and knocked it past the last defender before being sent crashing to the floor by a clumsy challenge.  Penalty!  Gildart stepped up and with supreme confidence thumped the ball into the corner for 2 &#150; 0.  <br>
										At this point the Jets should have been able to find the confidence to play a bit more football, but within minutes the Swiss had pulled one back and the game turned from a fairly even, if pedestrian affair, into something more akin to a siege.  A corner was headed goal-wards and in the melee of limbs and bodies an arm was seen to make contact with the ball.  Penalty!  The big Swiss sweeper stepped up and smashed it home emphatically for 2 &#150; 1.  Suddenly, sensing a comeback, the Swiss came to life and the Jets became nervous.  The prospect of throwing away vital points troubled Saitama and they started hacking the ball anywhere, along with a few of the Swiss forwards.  A succession of free kicks were awarded, each one closer to the area, until finally a good shooting opportunity presented itself, fairly central and a mere 20 yards from goal.  Once again the unfeasibly tall Swiss sweeper stepped up and curled a great effort off the post and back out for a striker to punt over the bar.  It was the last chance for the Swiss and at the sound of the final whistle the Jets breathed a huge sigh of relief &#150; an unexpected, but hugely welcome, 3 points. <br>
										With 5 out 7 remaining games against the teams in the lower half of the table the Jets have given themselves a great chance of staying up, but more big performances will be needed starting in next week&rsquo;s crucial game against fellow strugglers Jetro.<br>
