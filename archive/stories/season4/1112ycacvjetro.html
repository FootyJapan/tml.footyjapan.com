								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 12th Nov.</b> Another sunday lunchtime at YCAC, another ugly win for the home side. Mustn't complain of course, theres many a team that would give up their last baguette for an ugly win and it allowed us and the rest of the chasing pack to sneak back a couple of points on the runaway Hibs, courtesy of our old friends Sala.<br>
									<br>
									There's been much criticism of Salas performances against Hibs in recent years. Not in this column though. I've never agreed that&nbsp;they are a bunch of haggis eating surrender monkeys and and am more than happy to see my faith in them repaid. Well done you Chibians, the beers are on&nbsp;Kirk!<br>
									<br>
									Ok that was a feeble attempt to&nbsp;deflect attention from another modest YCAC performance. To be fair, conditions werent conducive to good football, a strong wind blowing end to end and a pitch getting bumpier by the week. Jetro were not as bad as advertised, either. They have some tidy lads up front and at the back but little in midfield and no Goalkeeper.<br>
									<br>
									It's a tad offside to criticise the oppo in these reports but I'm assured that Jetro dont read this rubbish anyway, so...their GK stank up the 1st half making the YCAC reluctance to test him in any shape or form that much more frustrating. IF he is&nbsp;reading this, my apologies, and I will concede that one of our players stank up the 2H, so fair dos. His name is Anthony and his ball control is better than his bowel control, enough said.<br>
									<br>
									Playing with the aforementioned gale directly behind them YCAC managed 2 goal attempts worthy of the name in the 1H. We were awarded&nbsp;a free kick&nbsp;fully 35 yds out. Through a series of secret hand signals we decided on plan 37b (ii) with a half pike and twist; thats the one where Damo closes his eyes and hits the sucker. I have never seen a ball hit harder, straighter or truer. Nobody on either team moved an inch as it crashed against the post and flew back straight back out almost to where Damian was still standing. Next week we will try 37b (iii), thats the one where Damo closes his eyes and hits the sucker 6 inches to the right<br>
									<br>
									Gary the Goalie has never really lived down the 60 yarder he let in last year which gave Sala, who else?, a 1-0 win. Hard as his teammates have tried to help him forget that one off abberation, which cost YCAC the League, several staff members their jobs&nbsp;and caused 3 marital breakups, the unveiling of a plaque in the clubhouse dedicated to the longest goal ever scored at YCAC obviously brought it all back. Gary came up with the bold idea of scrubbing the Sala record from the books by scoring one himself from an even greater distance. He launched a drop kick from his own area which landed on the Jetro penalty spot. It almost hit their GK but he just managed to get out of the way and it was heading into the net, on&nbsp;its historic mission of mercy to expunge all that pain and heartache when Joe popped up and got a toe to it.<br>
									<br>
									The arguments raged on in the bar afterwards so it was decided that they should settle it in the ring like men. Gary, realising that the winner would have to buy a jug, took a dive. Joe, through force of habit, hit the ground at the same time so a draw was declared. Joe gets the goal, however,&nbsp;to save us having to buy a new plaque<br>
									<br>
									The 2nd goal which finally put the game to bed was a decent one from Kitajima. Hes not likely to read the match report either so we wont dwell there. 4 wins on the trot, no goals conceded and the extravagent total of 6 goals scored. Ugly football, we love it<br>
