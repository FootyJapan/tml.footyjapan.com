									<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 4th March</b>, As the match preview promised, the game was cracker from start, when Ken could&rsquo;ve, and should&rsquo;ve put Lions ahead within seconds after pacing through the defence, only to see his shot go wide at the far post.<br>
										16 year old Omar (Lions), then slipped the ball past the experienced Fred and held off the challenges as he marched into the box, but putting his shot a few inches on the wrong side of the post.<br>
										Barbs Brazilian striker Eduardo, kept the Lions defence on the back foot as he rained down a few long rangers before Martin beautifully placed a 25 yard free-kick to give Barbs a 1-0 lead. In the dying moments of the first half, deja vu! Omar again marched into the box, and again put his shot wide. Lions Captain (ex-Barbs), Gaafar Somi was then introduced into the game as a striker.<br>
										Half-time, 1-0 to Barbs, and with players like Tatsuya, Ken, Ahmed Gaafar from Lions, and Eduardo, Toshi, and Hideki from Barbs dashing up and down the flanks, the ball was rallied from one side to the other more times than a table tennis match!<br>
										5 minutes into the second half, a through ball saw Ken chest the ball into his path from the right side of the box, and placed his shot at the near post to make it 1-1.<br>
										Ex-Barbs striker, Hussein was then introduced to play alongside Somi upfront with Ahmed Gaafar dropping to the left wing.<br>
										Ken was at the end of Hussein&rsquo;s through ball, but a brilliant tackle by Barbs skipper Andrew Ferguson prevented, possibly a second gaol for Lions.<br>
										Minutes later, a short corner gave Ahmed Gaafar all the time to hit a sweet curling ball from the left across to the far corner of the goal as Barbs keeper (ex-Lions) Mike watched helplessly as the score turned 2-1 in favour of Lions.<br>
										Barbs kept pushing, and as Lions failed to clear, the ball fell nicely to Eduardo at the edge of the box, and had it been a good day for Eduardo, it could&rsquo;ve ended up at the back of the net, however the experienced Lions keeper Terry (also Celts), was not troubled as the shot went wide.<br>
										Quick and counterattack football was played by both sides, and Barbs pushed for the equaliser which left them looking vulnerable on the counters, but neither side could capitalise on the chances.<br>
										Lions seem more comfortable now that a reliable keeper and returning defenders have been featuring lately.<br>
										If both teams played that well every game, it could&rsquo;ve been a different story for the league standings.<br>
										Man of the Match is either Barbs Andrew Ferguson, one of the few no-nonsense defenders in the league, or the young Ahmed Gaafar who attacked and defended brilliantly for Lions and scored a great goal. <br>
