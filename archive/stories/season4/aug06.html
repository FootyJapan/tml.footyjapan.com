					<p>There were rousing cheers and audible sighs of relief from the 17-candidates upon hearing that they had all qualified for the 1st4sport Level 1 Certificate in Coaching Football, following their final practical assessments held at the Oi Chou Rinkai Koen sports complex in central Tokyo this month. The 13 candidates who participated in the Level 2 course held two weeks earlier at the Yokohama Country &amp; Athletic Club, will be hoping for similar news come their final assessments next spring.<br>
						<br>
						&ldquo;The candidates were well above average to be fair,&rdquo; says FA Coach Educator Stephen Lister during a course debrief. &ldquo;And it was nice to have such a mixed bunch on the course. Aside from English candidates living in Japan, there were Americans, a Romanian, a candidate from Finland, as well as Scottish, Welsh and of course Japanese candidates,&rdquo; he says. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0816FAcourse.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

					<p><b>Shanghai, 26 &amp; 27th August.</b> &nbsp;The Hibs were invited to the bi-annual (once every 2 years) Shanghai tournament after our strong showing in Phuket 2005, including a victory over the organisers the Shanghai Shooters. We were supposed to have a squad of 12, but 4 late withdrawals brought us down to 8 in the 7-a-side tournament. Fortunately for us all our players were in good shape and included some of the fittest players in not only the Hibs but the whole TML. The tournament consisted of 16 teams (22 applied to enter)&nbsp;&nbsp;with 4 groups of 4. There were 4 &ldquo;seeded&rdquo; teams, (Shooters, Hibs, Strollers (Beijing), and the BFC) who were all placed in separate groups. The other teams were supposed to be put randomly into the other groups at the draw on Friday night. At the draw the Shooters manager &#150; a man of irrefutable class, diplomacy and style; John Joffre, told us the tournament magazines would be handed out after the &ldquo;draw&rdquo; as they already had the groups printed in them. His wry smile when he spoke of the randomness of the draw hinted it may have been somewhat less than random. As it turned out our group was being called the &ldquo;Group of death&rdquo;, luckily we were cast as Argentina. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0827shanghai7s.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

						<b>Shanghai, 26 &amp; 27th August.</b> &nbsp;British Football Club Tokyo may not have walked off with the trophy at last weekend's Shanghai Shooters tournament, but had there been a prize for noisiest team, they would have won it hands down. A cast of thousands, compared to the eight the TML's other representatives in China, Hibs, brought, should have fostered more calm despite the sweltering heat. Not so. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0827shanghai7s1.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Swiss Find their Shooting Boots.</h1>
					<p><b>OiFuto Dai Ni, Sun 27th August.</b> The Swiss start to the &rsquo;06-&rsquo;07 Metropolis is an ominous one for the rest of the league. &nbsp;Under new management following their disastrous 3rd place finish last year, a revitalized line-up found the scoring touch that seemed to be missing for most of the last 2 years.&nbsp; Incredibly, 4 goals were scored by a Swiss front line that last year was often referred to as impotent (and it wasn&rsquo;t just the girls). <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0827swissvjetro.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<h1 class="blue">Two early goals do for Sala.</h1>
					<p><b>OiFuto Dai Ni, Sun 27th August.</b> It&rsquo;s lovely, that new pitch at Oi Futo, lovely lovely lovely. It&rsquo;s also huge &#150; so huge in fact that one end is now on Tennozu Isle and the other encroaches on runway 2 of Haneda Airport. Another curiosity is, does anyone know what sport is played within those red lines there, the arcs and dashes and obtuse angles and the like? Kabbadi perhaps&#x2026;<br>

						None of which helped Sala at all, and all of which helped Saitama to their first win in Division 1. Two unanswered goals in the first half gave Saitama a perfect start to their new campaign, and left Sala pondering the oft-asked question &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we score?&rdquo; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0827jetsvsala1.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Jets Up For the Challenge.</h1>
					<p><b>Oi Futo2, Sunday 27th August.</b> The Saitama Jets picked up right where they left off after their promotion to Division 1, with a convincing win against a strong Sala team. Under the flood lights of Oi-Futo-Dai-Ni field on the newly renovated pitch, the Jets wasted no time in making their presence felt. Within the first two passes the ball found Ryan Loren, a quick move around a Sala defender and he was down the sideline uncovered. He cut back into the 18 yard box and threaded the needle to South African, Ryan Botta, the newest member of the Jets. Botta slid and converted for his first goal of the season...a nice Ryan-to-Ryan connection. Jets 1 - 0 after 30 seconds. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0827jetsvsala.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>
