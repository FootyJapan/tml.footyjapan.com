								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 11th Nov.</b> The Swiss were to play the Jets at 9 am in Saitama.&nbsp; For the notoriously late Swiss, a 7:45 meeting in Roppongi was a bad omen and the boys almost staged a repeat of the forfeit from two years earlier which handed the Hibs the title on the last game.&nbsp; Fortunately, we made it to the ground with 5 minutes to spare with a full squad, JP even brought the kit! &nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									JP tried a new lineup on the day to try and generate some offense for the sputtering Swiss, moving Kirk up front after 10 years in defense was a questionable move but management is willing to experiment. &nbsp;It was good to have Dave P. back in the lineup again after last weeks poor outing vs. the YCAC.&nbsp; Shio and Raffa stuffed up the backfield while ever reliable Aoki and Kai provided the other outlets going forward. &nbsp;Even Dale made a long awaited reappearance for the squad, good to have another battling midfielder to call on. &nbsp;The first few minutes of the game were a little unsteady with new players in different positions but the team eventually started to move it around.&nbsp; The Jets team was physical across the back line and every ball was a battle which meant no room for softies on the day.&nbsp; The first break of the game came from a pass out of the back to Kirk who stood even with the defense &#150; the Jets defense stopped and assumed he was offsides but the whistle didn&rsquo;t blow.&nbsp; Kirk turned and found Yuji rushing through on the left and he was able to knock it by the keeper having left the defense in his wake.&nbsp; 1-0 to the Swiss and hopefully it was just the start.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									It wasn&rsquo;t going to be a goal-fest though as the Jets tightened up the defense and tough tackling meant that none of the Swiss were going to find things comfortable.&nbsp; Uchida in the Swiss goal was rarely troubled except for the shot from distance or the occasional corner but the passing going back the other way could not be described as smooth. &nbsp;The second goal came from a short corner by Aoki to Kirk.&nbsp; He had some time and saw Raffaelle running all the way from midfield, the cross was placed on the 6 yard line for the Italian Stallion to knock it smartly into the left corner with a great header, 2-0. &nbsp;The rest of the half and most of the 2H were pretty stale, some tough tackling and a few complaints but overall the ref. was calling a good game.&nbsp; The Jets would move it nicely out of the back but things would break down in the final third due to the lack of a striker &#150; something that could hurt them the rest of the year. &nbsp;The Swiss had a few chances going the other way with Michael, Kai, and Dave all squandering some chances.&nbsp; The game really didn&rsquo;t offer too much to the one or 2 fans until one of the Jets players was ejected for giving a &lsquo;Zidane&rsquo; headbutt into Kirk&rsquo;s back following a tackle which earned Kirk a warning.&nbsp; This opened it up a little more and Kirk was able to score 2 goals in the final 5 minutes to make it 4-0 to the Swiss. &nbsp;Great passes from Michael enabled him to get in behind the defense.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									Overall, it was good play from the Swiss but a tired JP can tell you, it is better when we play to feet because the midfielders were doing a lot of extra running chasing after poor passes. &nbsp;Good game to all and hopefully we have more to look forward to.<br>
