									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, The Geckoes entertained Jetro on Sunday on the Misato beach and were looking forward to getting back on winning ways. Despite having played well (in parts) in most of their previous 4 games, the Geckoes had failed to pick up a point and were hoping for a convincing win against the bottom of the table side.<br>
										However that was not to be and it was clear from the start that Jetro would be up for this relegation six-pointer. The Geckoes started brightest but it wasn&rsquo;t long before Jetro started mounting some strong attacks. The Geckoes defence played well but found it increasingly difficult on a very bobbly pitch and there were a couple of dodgy moments from back passes that were just about cleared.<br>
										Jetro threatened with a couple of free kicks that were shot straight at the keeper and Ian and Masa in the middle dealt with most things. The Geckoes created very few chances of their own and at half time the score was 0-0.<br>
										The second half brought an improvement from the Geckoes with Paul, Kazu and Mikkel starting to link up better and we began to create more chances. Paul was unlucky to put a good chance over. But Jetro continued to threaten. Thankfully the defence held strong and what got past Ian and Masa was dealt with by Rob in goal.<br>
										The breakthrough came with about 15 minutes to go. The ball was played over the top and Paul flicked it on to Kazu who crossed to the unmarked Mikkel to hammer home.<br>
										Jetro seemed to lose belief at that point and although the Geckoes pressed for a second it wasn&rsquo;t to be and the final score was 1-0.<br>
										It wasn&rsquo;t a pretty game and is probably best summed up in the words of Ian Holloway, the Plymouth manager:<br>
										&lsquo;To put it in gentleman's terms if you've been out for a night and you're looking for a young lady and you pull one, some weeks they're good looking and some weeks they're not the best. Our performance today would have been not the best looking bird but at least we got her in the taxi.&rsquo;<br>
