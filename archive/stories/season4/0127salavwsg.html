									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 27th Jan.</b> Fine conditions at Hachioji&nbsp;saw two teams looking for all 3 points but for very different reasons.&nbsp; SALA, looking to continue their 9 game unbeaten run, were determined to put the pressure on the league leaders and remain in the chasing pack,&nbsp;which is&nbsp;tightly gathered at the top of the table.&nbsp; Similarly, the bottom of the table is just as congested, with 2 points seperating 4 of the bottom 5, so Geckoes were desperate to get 3 points in the bag, too.<br>
										<br>
										In the end, it was the top of the table representatives that triumphed in style with goals from Scottie, Giles, Toby and Ian.&nbsp; The latter being the pick of the bunch from my man of the match.&nbsp; Great game, Ian.&nbsp; Geckoes loan strike, and the opening goal of the game, was scored by Paul James.<br>
										<br>
										Due to this result and BFC's draw with France, 3 points now seperate the top 5, promising sports fans and fun-seekers everywhere a fine climax to the end of the season.&nbsp; Although, I'm sure many of you who are reading this report have promised a fine climax before and not delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										The match started well with Sala in the ascendancy,&nbsp;Scottie making good progress down the right and winning a few corners for Sala.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;man-mountain that is the&nbsp;Geckoes keeper was quick to come of his line though and dealt with all the corners comfortably.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										Sala then seemed to loose a bit of momentum, with a few passes going astray and lack of cohesion between the defenders, midfielders and the forwards.&nbsp; Most of their moves were breaking down and it was at this point that the Geckoes started pushing forward.&nbsp; Geckoes soon&nbsp;took the opportunity that Sala's weakness had presented to them&nbsp;and struck with a somewhat lucky cross-come-shot that looped over the slightly&nbsp;statue-esque Sid in goals.&nbsp; In Sid's defence though, &quot;he wasn't speeding, your Honour!&quot; - oops, sorry wrong case!&nbsp; In Sid's defence, the&nbsp;cross never should have left the Geckoe's no.8's boot, something that Ian honourably held his hand up for after the match.&nbsp; 0-1.<br>
										<br>
										Sala almost struck back immediately with some good work down the left from Pete, who put in an excellent ball across the 18 yrd box, which Giles just failed to connect with (or did he hear Brookey's&nbsp;legendary and baffling cry of&nbsp;&quot;Sid it&quot;?), the ball then ran on to Brookey who side-footed it first time just wide of the Geckoes left post.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										The warning signs were clearly there for the Geckoes, and Sala started coming forward in numbers.&nbsp; More importantly, Shigeru started to see more of the ball and it was his run and pass that led to Sala's first.&nbsp; After a neat turn he drove forward and with the strength to hold off two chasing Geckoes defenders he slotted a lovely pass to Scottie, who had held his run and stayed onside for what seemed like an ice age to him.&nbsp; Scottie then rounded the Geckoes keeper, avoided a last-gasp challenge from a defender, with the aid of a fortunate bobble, and drilled (some might say skiffed) the ball into an empty net.&nbsp;&nbsp;1-1.<br>
										<br>
										This goal seemed to&nbsp;give Sala the focus they needed and they started to&nbsp;make regular&nbsp;and swift attacks with quick ball movement from back to front and plenty of overlapping.&nbsp; The Geckoes didn't seem to have an answer, with their no. 11 looking their most dangerous player, but even he was forced to do most of his work from distance far away from the Sala goal.<br>
										<br>
										It was no suprise then when Sala scored two good team goals either side of the break.&nbsp; Giles slotted home the first of these, after great attacking wing play from Ian, who had&nbsp;marauded forward from full back, played a one-two with Shigeru (?) and then hammered in a solid shot which the Geckoes keeper saved well but could only parry to the unmarked and grateful Giles to poke into an empty net.&nbsp; 2-1.<br>
										<br>
										The second involved another nice one-two&nbsp;from&nbsp;Ian, whose raids down the both flanks were destroying the Geckoes.&nbsp; This time he passed the ball to Brookey, who beat his man and sprinted into the box.&nbsp; Despite repeated attempts from the leftback to catch up with Brookey, he managed to stay calm, draw the goalkeeper and slide a delightful ball across the six yard box to Toby, who like all good strikers was waiting to pounce, and he slammed the ball home into an empty net.&nbsp; 3-1.<br>
										<br>
										Between these two goals, Sala suffered the loss of their influential Captain, Guido, with a serious injury to his achilles.&nbsp; It was testament to the versatility and the spirit of Sala&nbsp;that they pushed on to win comprehensively despite this major setback.&nbsp; Yusuke,&nbsp;who had&nbsp;played very well in central midfield,&nbsp;dropped back to partner Clarkey in central defence, with the versatile Scottie taking over from Yusuke in midfield.&nbsp; It was Clarkey though who did the majority of the work in holding off the Geckoe's attacks that inevitably came towards the end of the match, with Doug Lee and Victor assisting at the back.<br>
										<br>
										At 3-1 the Geckoe's no. 8 struck the outside of the&nbsp;post from distance with a&nbsp;good left-footed volley which dipped at the last moment.&nbsp; But unfortunately for the Geckoes they couldn't turn their hard work into a goal despite the added skill of their no. 11 who threatened with two good runs into the box and two&nbsp;nice shots from outside the box which Sid was equal to.<br>
										<br>
										At the other end, Toby&nbsp;nearly scored&nbsp;but his shot was too close to the keeper, then&nbsp;Shigeru almost&nbsp;netted a peach after a great run from halfway but his shot&nbsp;went just wide of the upright.&nbsp; Some questions were asked though (more like obscenities bellowed) of the Geckoes defender who decided to make a bird whistle noise just as Shigeru was about to shoot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsportsmanlike conduct, or perhaps the defender was simply trying to order his next Bacardi Breezer at the Blue Oyster Bar?&nbsp; We shall never know.<br>
										<br>
										The points were sealed&nbsp;when Ian played another one of his trademark one-twos on the right flank.&nbsp; Taking the ball in his stride he pushed forward and when the defence backed off him he drilled the ball into the bottom corner from 18 yards for the best and final goal of the game.&nbsp; 4-1.<br>
										<br>
										Next week sees Sala take on the&nbsp;Kanto Celts in a tough game which Sala were very lucky to win last time round.&nbsp; Without Guido, it will be tough, but if Sala can continue to play the way they did after his injury&nbsp;on Saturday, then there's no reason why more pressure can't be applied to the teams at the top of the table.&nbsp;<br>
