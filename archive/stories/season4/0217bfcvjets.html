									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 17th Feb. </b>The day had started ominously for BFC, losing 3 squad players to the ravages of the 'common cold', the 'missing pink slip' and the 'secretary forgot to make a diary entry'. But cometh the hour, cometh BFC's top scorer Evans 'The Eggman' Kunyuga.<br>
										For the second time this season against this committed JETs side the Eggman poached a late, deserved, winner to seal the points for TML leaders BFC.<br>
										In fairness to BFC, the 2-1 scoreline was not an accurate reflection of the pressure the JETs were under. Fortunately for the JETs, the surprise inclusion of Fulchester United's on-loan keeper, Biri the Fish, saved them from what could've been a mauling.<br>
										Countless times Biri's fin-like propulsions saved the JETs from drowning in the February rains.<br>
										The first half was a decent affair with both sides looking to get forward to open the spoils. With the JETs successfully utilising long-ish through balls to get in behind the unusually static BFC defense and the BFC carving out a number of clear-cut chances, 0-0 at halftime was something of a surprise.<br>
										Some choice words from skipper Jon Day at half time got the BFC back on tracks as simple early to feet passing began to reap rewards. With great support being shown by fullbacks Leigh Manson and Jon 'Wardrobe' Best, the BFC finally seized control.<br>
										Midfielder Taka, who played his best game since joining BFC this season, sold the JETs defender a terrific dummy beforing rifling one home from just outside the box. 1-0 BFC.<br>
										Against the tide, a moment of near-post madness from BFC sweeper Morson saw him misjudge a corner that flew in at the near post to bring the JETs level. Game on again but it all seemed so unfair -- to the Jack Russell at least.<br>
										BFC team-mates stood staring at their bootlaces as Ginger Khan, who was replaying the incident alone, pointed out to no one in particular that, had he put his head in the way of the pigskin, he would indeed have banged into the goal-post. (Insert own profanity here.)<br>
										Momentary paralysis shaken off, shouts of 'It'll come, lads' could be heard from the BFC ranks. And come it did. Taka's point-blank header was miraculously flippered away -- and the follow-up. What was the Fishman on?<br>
										More chances came and went and, in typical BFC fashion, tempers began to fray ever such a little.<br>
										Until, that is, Paraguayan Carlos capped an excellent debut for BFC with a moment of wonderful vision, rolling a quick free kick into the path of the Eggman, who did the rest.<br>
										With Swan Lake-esque grace, Evans lashed the ball into the top corner with (how shall we put this?) the outside of his left foot before being swamped by blue shirts. Truly extraordinary. How he does it only the Eggman knows. Ooh ooh ooh, indeed.<br>
										Final score: 2-1 BFC but the JETs again made them work for the three points and were generous in defeat. They deserve to stay up.<br>
										A final word for the Wardrobe, who, in his final game for BFC, was not only rudely denied a first goal of the season by a full-length two flippered save by the un-biri-leavable keeper, but was even more controversially denied the MOM award.<br>
										Injured BFC keeper 'Beef' Jyrki Jaaskelainen gave that instead to the immense Brian Doyle at the back. And the Engine was running in the Tokyo Marathon the next day too. Catalogue raisonne!!!<br>
										The Wardrobe had to settle for the Jon 'The Second' Best award (this stuff is genius, isn't it?) mercilessly handed out by BFC's Finnish invigilator.<br>
										I'm sure I speak for all at the British Football Club in thanking the Wardrobe for everything he has brought to the club, both on and off the pitch, in recent seasons -&#150; top player, top lad. We wish you all the best back in Blighty and hope the occasional tour is not beyond you.<br>
