						Last game and barring an absolute freak thrashing (cup game aside) this game would see the Celts stay up in TML 1 next season. On a scorching hot surface Celts and Geckoes resumed after the washed out previous game.<br>
						Geckoes came into the game safe in division 1 and showing off some shiny new silverware. But it was the Celts who started brightly with some crisp passing and confident play. Yet good things rarely last especially for us and somewhat against the run of play a quick break by Geckoes allowed their centre forward to get in behind the back four, nip in front of Aki and finish well.<br>
						It could have got far worse as a very similar opportunity quickly followed but Aki stood up well. The tought of an 8-0 defeat never entered the mind! <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0617wsgvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 19th Nov.</b> 2 trips out to Misato in 2 weeks was somewhat of a shock for the travel weary Hibs, particularly as conditions were against our style of football each time. Last week it was Hurrican winds of &ldquo;Cyclone Sala&rdquo; which went against us and this week it was torrential rain for this tough fixture against the Celts.<br>
						As the last fixture of the day we braved the worst of the conditions and with the pitch so waterlogged and the rain relentless; if not for the absent of some hooded teens selling hubcaps we could have been forgiven for thinking we were playing on a Sunday morning in Dagenham. East London. The Celts had strong Irish contingent with a Gaellic football background, enough for them to be considered &ldquo;mudlarks&rdquo; to borrow a horse racing term <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/1119hibsvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 1st Oct.</b> An impressive performance against a temperamental France FC team saw BFC emerge victors earning themselves their first victory of the season following a string of draws against TML&rsquo;s stronger teams. The game was full of incident and concluded on the wet grass at Misato with the French reduced to 9-men and flamboyant referee Pietro Cristo vowing never to officiate another TML game again.<br>
						<br>
						BFC started the game poorly failing to clear their lines on the slippery surface and the French were gifted the first goal of the game with a simple tap-in that left BFC keeper Beef Jryki little chance. This was enough to awaken the sleeping beast that was BFC and in an instant the team responded, playing two-touch football out of the back and hitting the strikers on the move from midfield &#150; Al Himmer holding up the ball well, shrugging off defenders and laying off simply to the overlapping runners.<br>

At the draw the Shooters manager &#150; a man of irrefutable class, diplomacy and style; John Joffre, told us the tournament magazines would be handed out after the &ldquo;draw&rdquo; as they already had the groups printed in them. His wry smile when he spoke of the randomness of the draw hinted it may have been somewhat less than random.
