Whoever they have playing its doubtful they will have it so easy again.<br>
										Goal 1 came as our keeper (the 1st of the day) slipped when trying to change direction allowing the ball to innocuosly roll in from 25 yards.<br>
										Goal 2 was a free kick which perhaps should have been awarded as an indirect free kick for foot up, Kirk struck it well and the free kick was always on target - the keeper got a hand to it rendering the indirect argument void - but was unable to keep it out.<br>
										Goal 3 came when our 2nd keeper of the day failed to collect an innocuous through ball and Kirk knocked in<br>
										Goal 4 was a free header from a yard out after a corner<br>
										Goal 5 arrived when keeper 2 picked up a backpass and the resulting free kick was blasted in<br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/07/0429swissvcelts5.jpg" alt="" height="173" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">Goal 6 was a Celts goal for a change, Swiss defender missed the ball and Henry smashed in from a tight angle via the keepers legs.<br>
										Goal 7 came direct from a corner eluding keeper 3 and the defender on the back post<br>
										Goal 8 was yet another free header from a yard out from a corner<br>
										<br>
										7-1 and whatever could have gone wrong did. We were crap. No excuses here &quot;That is TML&quot; afterall<br>
										4 games to go against BFC, Geckoes, France &amp; Jetro. The Celts results will decide both the relegation places and the title if BFC can avoid defeat against us.If the Celts can avoid playing the sh**e we did on Sunday then we may even have a chance of an upset. Geckoes and France before that in Les Crunches and Jetro to follow in an as yet unscheduled potentially decisive game.<br>
