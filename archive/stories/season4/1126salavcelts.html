									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 26th Nov.</b> More twilight robbery than daylight, but robbery it was as Sala sneaked past a thoroughly impressive Celts team in Saitama on Sunday.<br>
										Sala found themselves on the back foot for much of the game, particularly in the early stages and during the middle of the second period, before Guido popped up like a thief in the night to capitalize on Celts&rsquo; impotency in front of goal.<br>
										<br>
										Sala had a &lsquo;full&rsquo; squad out, though missing Lenny and Sid and the Celts seemed to have a full compliment too. The evening was cool and the conditions ideal, with Sala fancying their chances on a good passing pitch.<br>
										Any notions of that however were turned upside down as the Celts got off to a flyer.<br>
										Over the first twenty minutes, Sala notched up a total of about three passes in their opponents half, culminating in a shot by Dan which the Celts keeper clung onto well. Apart from that it was all Celts.<br>
										Looking physically stronger and perhaps fitter than the notoriously slow starting Sala (Not helped by Dhugal&rsquo;s poorly timed housewarming party the night before), they blitzed Andy Cross&rsquo;s goal from the off.<br>
										Several chances came and went, including a dipping half volley from Benny?, which Andy did really well to tip over.<br>
										The inevitable goal came after about twenty minutes, with nice build-up play on the left leaving a striker free in the box, and the outnumbered Sala defenders unable to prevent him finishing well from six yards.0-1.<br>
										The introduction of Brookey on the right and Brian in the middle for Sala seemed to spark a bit of urgency, and saw far more possession for the men in white, with Brian and Shige starting to orchestrate things more effectively in an attacking respect.<br>
										The pressure culminated in a decent goal after about half an hour. Toby did well on the left and picked out Dhugal in the middle and the ever reliable Antipodean finished well on his left foot.1-1.<br>
										Sala were certainly the happier of the two teams at half-time, having played terribly and managed to stay level, and they took those thoughts back on to the pitch in the second half.<br>
										Andres and Yusuke on the left and Brookey and Ian on the right, eventually began overlapping as planned and this led to several opportunities, such as Charles riverdancing past two defenders (could do it every week but I don&rsquo;t want to&#x2026;) but nothing clear cut.<br>
										Suddenly Sala lost their impetus though and tired legs allowed Celts back into the game. They had several shots which went narrowly wide and were generally far more aggressive and determined.<br>
										Yet, after another set of substitutions by Guido, Sala picked it up again. Brian&rsquo;s powerful header from Brookey&rsquo;s corner was blocked on the line, and Brookey&rsquo;s free-kick was only parried by the keeper.<br>
										Toby then went clean through but failed to get enough power into his shot as the ball bounced awkwardly into his body.<br>
										Finally it came though. Andres hit a bullet free-kick that the keeper could only parry again, but Guido had seen enough from the previous occasion to take a chance on a repeat performance and so was perfectly positioned at the back post to slide in a winner, narrowly edging Clarkey to the distinction.<br>
										Sala made heavy weather of the last minute or two, but they did show the kind of resilience that, if employed from the beginning of the match, could have led to a less nervy finish. Oh well, three points and all that&#x2026;<br>
										At the end of the day, Sala could thank Andy C for keeping them in it in the first half, and Guido&rsquo;s overwhelming desire to play and to win, despite being injured and extremely old.<br>
										On a final note, I&rsquo;m sure everyone will join me in wishing Doug Lee all the best for his forthcoming nuptials. Unfortunately, he will subsequently be too busy to attend the unveiling ceremony for his plaque in the YCAC clubhouse.<br>
										Proof, if needed, that life just isn&rsquo;t fair. Something I&rsquo;m sure the Kanto Celts would agree with.<br>
