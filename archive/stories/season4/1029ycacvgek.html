								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 29th Oct.</b> It had been a most unusual start to the season for YCAC1, conceding 6 goals in their 1st 2 games against 12 for the whole of TML3. The last 3 games have been reassuringly familiar though, a hammering from Sala followed by 2 clean sheets and squeaked wins, as well as a smattering of toys on the ground around Joes prambulator. TML3 has merged into TML4<br>
									<br>
									Whether things are really business as usual we wont know until the bumps on the pitch and/or the wind off the bay&nbsp;start to dominate the storylines. This Sunday, on a warm windless early autumn day, however, YCAC was certainly not the worst place in the world to be playing your football. That honour might belong to Oi 1 from the look of the Sala report (note to Groundsman-thats the pitch we want when the H*bs visit next)<br>
									<br>
									The idylic conditions at lunchtime on Sunday seemed to warm the cockles of both teams hearts. These 2, generally good for handbags or at least a little spirited whinging, played 80 minutes without getting close to a booking or even really a harsh word.&nbsp;Thanks to Marcel for standing in for yet another Ref unable to locate the Club. Is it my imagination or do blokes dragged off the sidelines to help out get a much better deal from the players than if they had turned up in all the gear with Sids&nbsp;princely match fee burning a whole in their pocket? We'd have to ask Marcel, much maligned last week when the official ref and much appreciated this week when just helping out<br>
									<br>
									This weeks&nbsp;2 niller over the Geckoes was vintage YCAC. Skipper spends all week tinkering with permutations for a 16 man squad, the car journey from Tokyo fielding calls about last minute injuries, car accidents, incarcerations etc.&nbsp;and then the 5 minutes before KO begging a sub and a Ref&nbsp;before the Stiffs, who play just before the 1sts for this very reason,&nbsp;can escape to the Bar. The Geckoes, as with every other YCAC opponent so far this season, were there 1st, had more men and looked like a proper team warming up.<br>
									<br>
									For the next 80 minutes YCAC football was the usual cocktail of abysmal finishing and occasional opposition attacks broken up by Damian Harts telescopic left leg or Gary Hodgsons telescopic everything. The statisticians on the coaching staff keep records of the ratio of goals scored to absolute sitters missed. Its affectionately known as the&nbsp;banjo to cows arse ratio and young James Absolom actually managed to improve his by going 1 for 6 against the Geckoes. The YCAC spearheads, James and Gav Margetson worked like Trojans, however, and both deserved their goals. Gavs&nbsp;ended a period of sustained WSG pressure right after HT and James' finally killed off the game 10 minutes from the end<br>
									<br>
									A special mention for our good friend Phil Denham who&nbsp;also had a happy ending, no not the Wanchai kind, to what seems to have been a miserable week. Hes chewed up and spat out by last weeks skipper Brigade Commander&nbsp;&quot;KneeKapKev&quot; in the Celts match report; his wife, who had run off with a Fitness Instructor at the American Club the week before, came back; the kidnappers returned his kids because he refused to pay the ransom and he has totally ballaxed the weeks ironing so the maid has withdrawn her favours too. To cap it all&nbsp;his crown for owning the biggest &quot;F::k Off&quot; car in the team, some German jobbie,&nbsp;has been snatched from his ginga head by occasional Left Back Nick McDonald who has purchased a&nbsp;very smart, top of the range,&nbsp;Ford.<br>
									<br>
									Phil ran his frustrations out, covering almost every blade on the pitch ( and there still are quite a few)&nbsp;The massed ranks of the all ticket crowd must have wondered whether Phil was playing right midfield, left midfield or Right Back, such was his movement around the park. Our very own utilityman even found time to run the line at one point (During which time the 2 goals were scored). So this weeks MOM is Phil Denham. (Only beating out WSGs very tidy new Japanese defender because&nbsp;I dont even know his name, let alone what car hes got)<br>
									<br>
									<i>Note to Oppo right wingers. No need to disparage Nicks sister or mother, just throw in casually &quot;Loverley Aston Martin in the car park. Owner must have locked his keys inside though, hes trying to get in the window with a coathanger&quot; He wont even hang around long enough to butt you in the chest.</i><br>
