								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 16th Sept.</b> WSG kicked of the new season in fine style going 2-0 up on Sala after 20 mins into the new campaign the Geckoes new summer signings looked like they were settling nicely. <br>
									Goals from Simon Bromwell and Mikkel Trooen put the Geckoes on a roll and it was only the woodwork that stopped them from going even further into the lead after a sweetly struck free kick from Mikkel crashed of the bar. It was from resulting open play and a slightly fortuitous finish from Dhugal Beddingfield that Sala pulled one back gaining a foothold on the game and began to attack the WSG defence. But just as Sala were sniffing around for an equaliser Joff Bradley got his foot to the ball after the Sala defence failed to clear and WSG were 3-1 up going into the break.<br>
									<br>
									Sala to their credit were in no mood to lie down and accept defeat. <br>
									They started the second half strongly soon forcing a free kick on the edge of the WSG area which was crisply converted by Stephen Brooke-Smith and gave them a lifeline. <br>
									Sala with the bit between their teeth were awarded a penalty soon after and centre-half&nbsp; Paul Clarke made no mistake with the conversion bringing the game level.&nbsp; With Sala on the ascendancy, it took a string of fine saves in the last 15mins to keep WSG in the match and allow them to claim a share of the points. A fair result on the day in a game that lived up to the clich&eacute; &ldquo;a game of 2...oh you know the last bit&rdquo;.<br>
