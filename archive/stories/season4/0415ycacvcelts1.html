									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, Another must win game was finally won by the Celts. After the last few disappointing results there was a lot of relief among the Celts with the final whistle.<br>
										<br>
										A fine team performance with the bare 11 made it all the more satisfying. Both teams made attempts to play a passing game despite the lunar like surface which led to the notorious bobble being widely blamed for misplaced passes and off target shots and there were plenty of them.<br>
										<br>
										The lottery that is Misato's pitch can affect any player but thankfully Henry showed enough poise in the first half to convert from a tight angle after a long ball over the top was dropped by the YCAC keeper.<br>
										Celts mostly held YCAC attacking threats at bay with a great holding midfield performance from Rick with Libor and Denis particularly doing well at the back.<br>
										<br>
										The start of the second half saw YCAC with Joe and Neil trying to drive forward which left more space at the back which Soh and Kim exploited with Ronaldoesque dribbling. A multitude of good opportunities came and went for the Celts which we hoped would not come back to haunt us. Eventually, one such chance was converted again by Henry as he ghosted into the box, calmly went around the keeper and finished the game.<br>
										<br>
										Well done to the ref for allowing the game to flow and to Steve for a very generous YCAC report. But especially thanks to the 11 Celt lads who turned up for an early kick off in the Saitama dust plains to keep our fight for survival alive.<br>
