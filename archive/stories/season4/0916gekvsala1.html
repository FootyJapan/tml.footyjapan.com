								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 16th Sept.</b> </p>
								<p>Sala&rsquo;s baffling inability to play from the start cost them two points for the second week in a row at Hachioji on Saturday, as they were again forced to come from two goals down to grab a draw.</p>
								<p>TML league organizer and self styled &lsquo;Tzar of Football&rsquo;, Sala&rsquo;s own Sid Lloyd, is now considering the option of barring first halves altogether, and playing only the second forty minute period.</p>
								<p><i>&ldquo;That way we could get two games per booking on every pitch, and when we make it retro-active to the start of the season, Sala will be top of the league, so everyone&rsquo;s a winner.&rdquo;</i> Quoth the Sid.</p>
								<p>Seriously though, Sala might just have well turned up at half time, because a late strike from Dhugal aside, there were very few positive things to be said about the opening half. Indeed if praise were to be heaped, it would amount to a very small heap indeed.</p>
								<p>Geckoes, playing their very first game of the season, obviously couldn&rsquo;t believe their luck, and for the opening thirty minutes they turned the tepid Sala inside out.</p>
								<p>Two goals in those thirty, a well taken strike from a lovely one touch knockdown, and a chip/shot that floated right into the top corner, put Sala almost out of reach.</p>
								<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until Geckoes came closest to making it three, a free kick which cannoned off the bar, that Sala finally woke up.</p>
								<p>Dhugal, who had just seen a first effort ruled out for offside, latched on to a through ball, cut inside his man and floated a chip over the keeper&rsquo;s head to make it 2-1, though the keeper will probably be a little disappointed that he couldn&rsquo;t quite keep it out.</p>
								<p>Almost immediately though, a defensive bungle, claimed by Clarkey in his and Yusuke&rsquo;s names, allowed Geckoes in the backdoor again. A scrappy finish made it 3-1 and the half time whistle blew, leaving Sala, hands on hips in disbelief. But any neutral observer would have pointed out that it was 3-1 going on 7-1, and in some ways Sala were lucky that the game was not already over as a contest.</p>
								<p>Stung by Guido&rsquo;s urgency at half time, Sala returned to the pitch a different beast and, it should be pointed out, not merely because of personnel changes. From the get go, the hunger strangely lacking in the first period returned, just as it had done a week earlier against BFC.</p>
								<p>Inside the first ten minutes Sala clawed one back. Sala began playing almost exclusively down the right, where Ian, Shigeru and Brookey started most of Sala&rsquo;s attacking moves.</p>
								<p>Indeed it was Shigeru&rsquo;s quality first time pass that put Giles away and clear. He shrugged off what he thought to be the first chasing defender only to find it was his strike partner Charles, and was then upended on the edge of the box. Though it couldn&rsquo;t have been clearer that the tackler was the last man, Quentin decided against even a booking.</p>
								<p>Aided by some kind of miscommunication between wall and keeper, which had them standing in front of each other, Brookey stepped up and curled a sidefoot effort into the bottom right corner with very little pomp. 3-2.</p>
								<p>The game was afoot, and Sala&rsquo;s own Watson, Brooke-Smith, began to put Geckoes to the sword.</p>
								<p>It was his swerving through ball to Shigeru that saw the Sala midfielder upended in the box for a long awaited Sala TML penalty.</p>
								<p>Clarkey, who has been as reliable as a Bangkok Tuk-Tuk driver of late from twelve yards, tucked it comfortably home to level the match. 3-3.</p>
								<p>After that, the game read much like the script of the Steven Segal movie &ldquo;Under Siege&rdquo;, except without the battleship and the stripper coming out of the cake and the stage directions etc etc.</p>
								<p>Charles was unlucky not score after playing a ridiculously long range one-two with the sprightly Giles and getting crippled by the man mountain that is Geckoes keeper.</p>
								<p>Dhugal went close with a shot that stung the fingertips of said mountain, and Shige got in on the act, somewhat unadvisedly trying to lob the mountain, only to see his effort drift wide.</p>
								<p>113 corners came and went, Guido flashed a couple of headers wide, Clarkey began playing defence for the Geckoes, Sala fielded 12 players for a short time in a last ditch effort to win the game, these were the incidents that marked the last ten minutes.</p>
								<p>The scoreline however, showed a resolute lack of desire to change and so the game ended 3-3.</p>
