					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 28th Jan.</b> The British Embassy came through a stern test of their leadership credentials last Sunday with a hard-fought win in Yokohama. The Embassy had turned up to face YCAC 2nds, but there had obviously been some kind of mix-up with the fixtures as the game turned out to be against YCAC 1sts. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0128ycac2vbefc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 27th Jan.</b> The Jets&rsquo; TML 1 campaigned continued in familiar style &#150; a narrow defeat against one of the top teams. The goal coming mid-way through the first half &#150; a good cross from the right went over everyone&rsquo;s head and was volleyed home from 15 yards by the left midfielder, off the inside of the far post. YCAC will no doubt consider themselves worthy winners and will feel that they could have scored more, however, the Jets had a few chances and with a bit more belief in the final third could have improved on their dreadful scoring record. In all though, despite competing all over the pitch the Jets were once again found wanting in the goals department. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0127jetsvycac.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 28th Jan.</b> Clearly from the start of this game we could see who was more up for it, or should I say ready for the kick-off time. While Vags lined up for the kick-off, the Lions had maybe 7 players on the pitch while the others casually changed on the sidelines without any sign of panic or look as though they were in a rush.<br>
						<br>
						Eventually kick-off occurred a little over 5 minutes later than the original time with Lions finally having 8 players on the pitch, giving the referee the chance to air his whistle for the first time of the match. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0128vagsvlions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

															The match kicked of with what can only be described as a shocking first 10 minutes for the Celts, almost as if we had never played together before and Geckoes capitalized on the situation with some fine interplay culminating with a good build up and finish to take the lead 1-0 (with some luck from a few unfortunate bounces and missed clearances from the Celts dozing Defense). <br><br>

															<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 21st Jan.</b> Having just seen BEFC score late in their game to go top of the league, BFC Vags knew exactly what was required of them. News of a remarkable 3-0 victory by the BFC added to the pressure to maintain the good name of British Football Club. And of course they also wanted to send Tom off to New York in winning style.<br>
																<br>
																So it was disappointing but depressingly familiar to find ourselves down 2-0 after half an hour. That said, this was not the typical Vagabonds' style of nodding off at the start of the game. Maritizio&rsquo;s winning run was proving to be no fluke. Solid and mobile in midfield, composed at the back and with a skilful, pacey striker, they soon let us know we had a quality game of football on our hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0121vagsvmar.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

																<br>
																BFC were tonked 4-1 in the first meeting between the sides this season, turning up at St. Mary's with a bare eleven.<br>

																Much had been made of France's dominance over Sala in the TML in recent years.&nbsp; Amazingly Sala had managed just a solitary point from the five previous league meetings between the two sides and the heartache of last season's cup semi-final defeat on penalties was still fresh in their memories.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0120salavffc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

																The depleted YCAC 2nd squad was augmented with Steve Taw making a rare appearance at centre-half, and with some new faces in midfield (Neil Shonhard) and upfront (Jamie Richards). It was pretty clear from kick-off that our debutants knew where the goal was, with a powerful header from Neil being cleared on the line.  <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0114ycacvamanis.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

YCAC, the Swiss, Hibs, Sala and BFC arrived fielding notably strong squads, but due to the expansive size of the pitches (causing the 3/4 sized goals to appear as mere specks on the horizon at times) any of the teams who capitalized on their goal-scoring chances, sporadic as they might be, would have a good chance of leaving the competition clutching silverware. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/archive/stories/0607/07fjnewyear7s.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
