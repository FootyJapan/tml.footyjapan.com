									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 26th Nov.</b> Hachioji Park was the venue where Lions aimed to go back to winning ways, and it looked like a great opportunity, especially when Lions found out that Rouven, a crucial midfielder for Amanis was absent.<br>
										Lions started with a 3-5-2, where Mohammed Birkiya and Ken Hersche played as left and right wing-backs very effectively, with Ken scoring from Gaafar's lay-off, beating the keeper by driving his shot into the far top corner from the right edge of the box.<br>
										Lions lost concentration, by playing the Amanis striker onside, scoring on a one-on-one with the stand-in keeper Bashaar. A few minutes after kick-off, Gaafar again laid the ball across to Ken, who put in the best cross you may see in the TML, pin-point at the far-post where Gaafar headed the ball powerfully back across the goal as the Amanis keeper helplessly watched the ball hit the back of the net to make the score 2-1.<br>
										With 5 minutes to go, the skillful, but unpredictable AbuBakar (Afro-man), took the ball over 30 yards, with many options for a killer pass, but decided to go alone, only to lose the ball, allowing a 4 on 2 counter-attack for Amanis, who eventually scored from 7 yards out, by hitting a powerful low shot to the left of the 2nd stand-in keeper Mo Shehata who only a few minutes earlier swapped his striking position with Bashaar.<br>
										The first half finished 2-2, and 5 minutes into the second half, disaster struck, when Gaafar pulled a hamstring after chasing a through ball. Lions had to bring on AbuBakar again after being taken off at half-time. The Amanis keeper would've had a sleepless night if Bashaar capitalised on the keeper's clearance that hit Bashaar on the back 4 yards out! Bashaar was taken by surprise but as he turned around, he hit a poor shot straight at the keeper. If Lions hoped for this chance to fall to someone it would have been the ex-Saudi Under-21 international, Bashaar, but lack of match practice was evident.<br>
										Ken was moved into a right back position to allow the pacey Tatsuya to play as a right winger, and had Gaafar still been on, he would've caused problems from Tatsuya's crosses that were unchallenged by AbuBakar and Bashaar. Tatsuya had a good shooting opportunity outside the box, but sent the ball a yard or 2 above the bar. In the last 15 minutes, Hussein, who was coaching from the sidelines with Abda, came on to replace Bashaar who surprsingly squandered another opportunity from Tatsuya's low driven cross.<br>
										A rare attack for Amanis, saw Sima challenge their striker in the box, getting the ball, but his follow through took the player, allowing Jorge to squeeze the ball past Mo from the penalty spot with less than 10 minutes to go to make it 3-2, the first time Amanis went ahead in the game!<br>
										2 minutes from time,&nbsp;a long ball from Mohammed Birkiya was headed down by Hussein to AbuBakar 8 yards out, and as Lions held their breath expecting AbuBakar to finish reliably from such a position, he miskicked the ball that bobbled wide of goal.<br>
										Omar Birkiya was definetely missed in central midfield for Lions, although Raouf and Gamil played well together in midfield. Jorge the Amanis captain was quiet in the first half, but dominated the midfield in the second half. The consistent performer yet again, Ken Hersche, worked tirelessly in 3 different positions, scored a great goal, and put in an amazing cross for Lion's second goal. No doubt Ken was an MVP in his college days, does not deserve to be on the losing side, but if any consolation, he was by far Man of the Match.<br>
