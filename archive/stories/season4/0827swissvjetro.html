								<p><b>OiFuto Dai Ni, Sun 27th August.</b> The Swiss start to the &rsquo;06-&rsquo;07 Metropolis is an ominous one for the rest of the league. &nbsp;Under new management following their disastrous 3rd place finish last year, a revitalized line-up found the scoring touch that seemed to be missing for most of the last 2 years.&nbsp; Incredibly, 4 goals were scored by a Swiss front line that last year was often referred to as impotent (and it wasn&rsquo;t just the girls). &nbsp;<br>
									Even though the last goal was due to the generosity of the referee when he awarded us a PK (I think that might have happened against the Hibs. last year), one can only say that the clear superiority of the Swiss side deserved the victory.&nbsp; Solid efforts by Kai, Dave, Yan up front, and as always, Peter in goal were the key.&nbsp; <br>
									The effort required to get 13 players to the pitch on time, get clean uniforms to each and everyone, keep all the players in their positions, and then to chauffeur them back to the station &#150; the Swiss manager deserves praise far beyond what the 3 points and +1 goal differential can convey. <br>
									<br>
									&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think anyone can argue with the fact that the Swiss have to be the team to beat this year since we have all read about the Hibs. futile efforts to claim victory against the Shooters in Shanghai and the YCAC &#150; well continues to be the YCAC.&nbsp; <br>
									This writer wasn&rsquo;t even at the game he is writing up but since the opposition (Jetro) is incapable of writing anything up much less reading my commentary about their loss, I guess this will have to be the report that goes up on the site. &nbsp;Well done to the Swiss that currently lie 2nd in the league due to the mere technicality of a scab keeper for Sala (since their first choice was playing in Shanghai) not being able to keep out more shots against the Jets.&nbsp; <br>
									The Swiss are back with JP at the helm!<br>
