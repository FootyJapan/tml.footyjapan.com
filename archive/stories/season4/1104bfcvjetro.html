								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 4th Nov.</b> The Eggman turned clairvoyant at the weekend with a classy hat-trick in BFC's 5-1 win over Jetro. As predicted he scored with his left, right and his head (well, left ear, although he leapt over tall buildings to knock Ryo's corner past the Jetro goalkeeper).<br>
									Shosuke and Terry were also on target as BFC hit back from last week's disappointing defeat by champions Hibs with a convincing performance in Saitama.<br>
									<br>
									Shosuke gave BFC a deserved lead after 15 minutes, toe-poking Pink Neil's cross into the bottom corner after sneaking in at the back post. Evans got in on the act soon after, latching on to a superb through ball from Jay to lob the Jetro keeper with style (right foot).<br>
									Captain Jon was unlucky with a carbon copy chance before Evans gave his left foot an airing. Jon's pinpoint long ball found a streaking Evans (revolting thought, that), who coolly rounded the keeper before sliding the ball into the empty net. 3-0 at the half.<br>
									BFC should have added many more goals to their total in the second half but a combination of a poor final ball and some batty refereeing did little to help their cause.<br>
									Referee Kazu gave Jetro a phantom penalty to reduce the deficit, although Big Jyrki got more than a whiff as the ball skimmed his Kenny Everett gloves.<br>
									At the other end, Taka was crudely hacked down in the box but Kazu clearly had the hump by now and said no, despite the linesman's flag and the fact the Jetro players had stopped playing in anticipation of a peno.<br>
									Taka had an excellent game, twice coming close to scoring, while Shosuke gave Jetro constant problems with his darting runs down the right. Leigh, Dr. Phil and James, who had a solid game on his return, all left their deckchairs to charge forward in the second half, while Jon Best was sprinting up the left touchline like a ravenous Freddy Starr chasing a hamster lunch.<br>
									However, a fourth goal was to come via a set piece. Ryo's floated corner looked harmless enough until the Eggman stubbed out his Malboro Light and rose to glance a header into the top corner. Top shelf. Kazu was guilty of another staggering decision in the last 15 minutes as skipper Jon was mugged by the Jetro goalkeeper -- lunging two-footed and the last man, the keeper had to go. Kazu produced only a yellow.<br>
									Jon dusted himself down and moments later unselfishly teed up Terry to stroke home BFC's fifth, capping the team's best performance of the season.<br>
									Jay's guest appearance for his old team reminded the BFC's old guard of past glories (well, of the past anyway) and securing the artful Cockney on a season's loan from Penang would be nice.<br>
									The Eggman's hat-trick was the icing on the cake, though, even if we were still hearing about it in a Roppongi club at 2 a.m.<br>
