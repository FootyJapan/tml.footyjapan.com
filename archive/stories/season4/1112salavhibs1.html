									First half with the wind in our backs,&nbsp;Hibs&nbsp;seemed to start with usual confort of pace and posession, often creating good chances. The fisrt goal came in&nbsp;from a cross after a good combination and buildup from left side&nbsp;which saw Steve finishing with quality. There were of several chances which&nbsp;we did not convert, which turned out&nbsp;to be&nbsp;costly.&nbsp;<br>
									The second half was an exact opposite of the first half. With wind in our faces we struggled. Oppoturnistic Sala&nbsp;in our moment of panic brought more men forward, one&nbsp;stretch of play&nbsp;had Sala&nbsp;oracle man&nbsp;Lenny put in a tricky winding cross to the far post with his left foot to Dhugal, who beat Yasu &amp; Hitoshi with header just inside of the goal post. Sala also had two more decisive chances both from 3 yards out but failed to convert in the hard conditions. In last play with the referee looking at his watch, Hibs finally went in deeper into Sala territory. Nice build up play lead by Naoki, Keita and Steve&nbsp;put Yohei inside box with room for shot from a 45 degree angle.&nbsp;The shot went a few balls wide of far post with Sid watching gratefully, no get-out-of-jail card rewarded&nbsp;to Hibs this afternoon.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Considering how&nbsp;Hibs went about this match we were extremely lucky to get out of this nightmare with a point.<br>
									From a veiw from back,&nbsp;Sala deserved to walk away with all three points. As the midway to the season schedule nears, it may have been a good&nbsp;wake-up call&nbsp;that there are absolutely no easy&nbsp;matches in the TML.<br>
