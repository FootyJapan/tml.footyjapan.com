					<p><b>OIFuto, Sun 10th Dec.</b> Not much to say really. Sala and The Swiss Kickers have now shared three games in a row, with only two goals scored and chances few and far between. Yesterday&rsquo;s result came then, as little surprise.<br>
						<br>
						What it did do is play nicely into the hands of Hibs (again) and the other teams in the chasing pack, YCAC and BFC.<br>
						<br>
						The first half started dramatically enough with Brookey creaming a half volley from the edge of the box that was bound for the top corner, until the Swiss keeper got a paw to it and turned it spectacularly over. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1210salavswiss.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>OIFuto, Sun 10th Dec.</b> While the TML has a real shortage of grass pitches, seeing the Oifuto ground on the Sunday must have bought back memories for some of us more familiar with mud wrestling.<br>
						<br>
						With plenty of waterlogged areas of the pitch clearly visible for all to see, it was clear that both team were in for a potentially treacherous encounter. For those who relish the good old fashion English style slide tackles, it was going to be a fun day. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1210marvafc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hanno, Sat 9th Dec.</b> He is the Eggman. Ooh ooh ooh ooh. An acrobatic bicycle kick from the Eggman gave BFC a deserved 2-1 win over the Saitama JETs on a rainswept evening in the middle of bloody nowhere on Saturday. Eggman's sixth of the season left his team-mates gaping in stunned awe as they tried to work out which part of his anatomy had connected with the ball more. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1209bfcvjets.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

As the Jets took over responsibility for running the tournament, established by the TML&rsquo;s Sid Lloyd, this year&rsquo;s event was held in the form of a futsal tournament <a class="txlink" href="http://ngildart.com/Paul_Adamson_Memorial_Cup" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Vags Cruise to the Top.</h1>
					<p><b>Misato, Sun 3rd Dec.</b> Victory in a hard-fought and competitive game against Barbarians FC took the Vags to the giddy heights of the Division 2 table.<br>
						<br>
						On a pitch bathed in Arctic sunshine both teams played hard from the off, the Vags plan to get in early thwarted by equal determination from the Barbarians and the ice rink qualities of the pitch. After some early pressure, the Vags defence settled down and started to take control, blunting the opposition attacks and getting some nice balls down the wings, on the deck and to feet, a nice addition to play this season!<br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 3rd Dec.</b> Yet another Misato trip for the fast-improving Clash saw them take 3 more points in a match played in good spirits against Stoneds FC. Despite losing several players to international commitments (Japanese Proficiency Test) the Wall Street side pressured their opponents from the beginning and, in scoring 4 more goals, have already matched their season 3 tally.<br>
						<br>
						Kazz Ishizaki opened the scoring after 25 minutes with a delightful curled effort from the edge of the box, followed soon afterwards by athletic forward Mick Dorrian with another long range effort, sadly missed by your reporter who was answering the call of nature..<a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1203clavsto.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
