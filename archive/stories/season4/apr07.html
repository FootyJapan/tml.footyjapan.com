					<p><b>OiFuto 1, Sunday 29th April</b>, The pitch was waterlogged but the weather was beautiful enough to offset the mud at Oifuto on Sunday.&nbsp; A nearly full strength Swiss team had gathered to do battle with the Celts who appeared to be missing a few key players.&nbsp; It is an unusual luxury for a Swiss team that has struggled for consistency in lineups and form this year. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0429swissvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Abysmal!</h1>
					<p><b>OiFuto 1, Sunday 29th April</b>, Celts tamely rolled over to an average Swiss side with a talented Englishman and someone who claims to be Irish up front, several Japanese in midfield and defence, and perhaps a Swiss or two somewhere on the pitch. Whoever they have playing its doubtful they will have it so easy again. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0429swissvcelts1.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 28th April</b>, A fabulous goal from Pink Neil gave BFC a 1-0 win over Jetro to leave them needing one point from their final two games to secure a first TML title.<br>
						Comments from TML rivals talking of 'gifting' BFC the championship were rendered well and truly absurd as, once again, BFC were forced to grind out a tough win Bung Meister George Graham would have been proud of. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0428bfcvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The opponents this time were WS Clash who were 3 points ahead and 8 goals better than Lions. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0422lionsvwsc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<h1 class="navy">JETS s Storm Back to Claim Point From Hibs.</h1>
					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 21st April</b>, Saitama Jets produced a stirring second half comeback to grab a point from last season&rsquo;s champions, Hibs, at Hachioji Park on a hot Saturday afternoon. Hibs led 2 &#150; 0 at half time thanks to two quality strikes, but perpetual substitute Shimizu laid claim to a starting place in the Jets&rsquo; attack with two superb finishes late in the second half to continue the Jets&rsquo; recent good run of form. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0421jetsvhibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, The Geckoes entertained Jetro on Sunday on the Misato beach and were looking forward to getting back on winning ways. Despite having played well (in parts) in most of their previous 4 games, the Geckoes had failed to pick up a point and were hoping for a convincing win against the bottom of the table side. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0415wsgvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, Life has an annoying way of crushing ones spirit underfoot, like Godzilla leaping off a tall building onto a paper bowl of trifle.<br>
						Although Sala somehow clung on to take a barely deserved three points from France, I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the old adage: When is a win not a win?<br>
						The answer being; when you are making a return after a lengthy injury, decide to gamble on a tentative ten minute spell before half time to test the water, and end up scoring an own-goal and pulling your hamstring quite nastily, so that you are lying in disgrace and intense pain (Not to mention, intriguingly, in a state of semi-arousal) before the halftime whistle even blows.

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th April</b>, In a dour battle with few quality chances between them, the Hibs and Swiss fought to a draw at Misato. &nbsp;The result likely ended both teams' chances of edging out the BFC for the league&nbsp; title&nbsp;.&nbsp; Both teams were missing players for this game but the Swiss haven't done much in terms of recruiting and looked to be worse off at the start. &nbsp;The Hibs come at you with a large back line, that never seems to move forward, and leaves the entire game to its creative midfielders. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0415swissvhibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						<br>
						It was an end-to-end game with very few chances, with both keepers making several excellent saves and both teams defending well. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0408hibsvsala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 8th April</b>, Saitama Jets extended their excellent record against Kanto Celts with goals from John Rayner and Nate Gildart to all but secure their place in TML1 for next season.<br>
						<br>
						The Jets lined up against the Celts knowing that victory would surely be enough to make their final two games of the season academic. The Jets have grown into TML1 as the season has progressed and recently have learnt how to win games that would have been lost at the start of the season. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0408jetsvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

We knew we were in for a tough match with the Geckoes who were in a relegation scrap and looking for revenge after the 10-0 drubbing by the Hibs in round one. The Hibs were hit once again by injury with Mick O&rsquo;Hagan ruled out with a hamstring injury sustained while playing in a corporate game on the Saturday. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0401hibsvwsg.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

You could write a novella about this game if you were that way inclined. The stakes were high and are worth reiterating: lose, no promotion. Win, chance of promotion.

The game started well with a series of attacks repelled by last ditch Jetro defending and at least one good save from the keeper. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season4/0401celtsvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
