					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 26th Nov.</b> More twilight robbery than daylight, but robbery it was as Sala sneaked past a thoroughly impressive Celts team in Saitama on Sunday.<br>
						Sala found themselves on the back foot for much of the game, particularly in the early stages and during the middle of the second period, before Guido popped up like a thief in the night to capitalize on Celts&rsquo; impotency in front of goal. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1126salavcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 26th Nov.</b> Hachioji Park was the venue where Lions aimed to go back to winning ways, and it looked like a great opportunity, especially when Lions found out that Rouven, a crucial midfielder for Amanis was absent.<br>
						Lions started with a 3-5-2, where Mohammed Birkiya and Ken Hersche played as left and right wing-backs very effectively, with Ken scoring from Gaafar's lay-off, beating the keeper by driving his shot into the far top corner from the right edge of the box.<a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1126lionsvamanis.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 19th Nov.</b> 2 trips out to Misato in 2 weeks was somewhat of a shock for the travel weary Hibs, particularly as conditions were against our style of football each time. Last week it was Hurrican winds of &ldquo;Cyclone Sala&rdquo; which went against us and this week it was torrential rain for this tough fixture against the Celts.<br>
						As the last fixture of the day we braved the worst of the conditions and with the pitch so waterlogged and the rain relentless; if not for the absent of some hooded teens selling hubcaps we could have been forgiven for thinking we were playing on a Sunday morning in Dagenham. East London. The Celts had strong Irish contingent with a Gaellic football background, enough for them to be considered &ldquo;mudlarks&rdquo; to borrow a horse racing term <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1119hibsvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 19th Nov.</b> Not the prettiest exhibition of football on a cold damp Misato morning but another 3 Points on the board for WSG, although they did make it hard on themselves against a 9 man Jetro.<br>
						<br>
						The game started in the same manner as the weather conditions and it took a surprise counter attack to rudely awaken the sleepy Geckoes. Jetro broke quickly and their sprightly winger found the head of Kobayashi leaving WSG 1-0 down and facing another humiliating defeat for the 2nd time this season. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1119gekvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Todoroki, Sat 18th Nov.</b> At a charming Todoroki park (sans penalty boxes and symmetrical goalposts) on Saturday night, Sala came up against a team named after a theoretical pre-historic super-continent for the first time in club history.<br>
						On the day, captain Guido chose to spectate rather than play, mainly due to the grotesque swelling in his lower legs which has caused his shin pads to stretch so much, that they have become virtually unusable. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/pages/fjtnews.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 12th Nov.</b> A very windy and slightly chilly afternoon was the setting for this crunch game between 2 teams which like to battle it out. Last season was a 1-0 defeat for the Vags against the same opposition so it was important to avenge that loss which had Vags endure a lousy season from that game onwards.<br>
						<br>
						A brand new kit was enough to put a smile on everyone`s face, not to mention the extra skip in our step. Vags were changed since their last game (3-1 vs YCAC2nds). The loss of boys Graeme, Brian, Maz, Lyndsey etc allowed for the returns of Ian, Patrick, Gary and Chris into the team. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1112vagsvafc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

The Eggman poached (eh, Jerry?!) a deserved equaliser at the start of the second half after Jon Day's shot was well blocked by the Celts goalkeeper. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1111bfcvcelts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 12th Nov.</b> Spirits high after their comfortable win over bottom-of-the-tabke Jetro&nbsp;in the quagmire of Oi Mud, Sala travelled this week to windy Misato to take on the all-conquering top-of-the-table Hibs.&nbsp; Sala had reason to be apprehensive heading into the match after conceding an astonishing total of 16 goals in the last two encounters between the two sides.&nbsp; Preparations weren`t helped when playmaker Shige again ventured to the wrong ground.&nbsp; In the absence of defensive stalwart Clarkey and strikers Roddy Charles and Giles Legg, Guido opted for a cautious approach, employing an unfamiliar 5-4-1 formation, leaving the tireless Toby Long up front by himself. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1112salavhibs.html" target="_blank">more from Sala...</a><br>

						On Sunday morning two and half hours&nbsp;travel to Misato, a&nbsp;&nbsp;match against a physical Sala squad at&nbsp;an away pitch with violent gusts of wind was a dangerous combination for Hibs to solve.&nbsp;The above conditions considered, and playing&nbsp;without their usual&nbsp;intensity,&nbsp;Hibs somehow scraped a tie in their worst game of the season.. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1112salavhibs1.html" target="_blank">more from Hibs...</a><br>

Mustn't complain of course, theres many a team that would give up their last baguette for an ugly win and it allowed us and the rest of the chasing pack to sneak back a couple of points on the runaway Hibs, courtesy of our old friends Sala. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1112ycacvjetro.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

The Swiss will meet the winner of the preliminary match up between YCAC 1st XI and AFC Wanderers meaning that one of the big guns will be departing the tournament early doors. With the losers of the preliminary and first round games going into a Plate competition there's a lot more football to be played in this season's cup competition. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/pages/fjcup.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

Well it must also be a sign of something else because The Embassy managed to sneak away from Misato last Sunday with all three points despite being second best for large periods of what was, for the most part, a third rate game. While the Embassy will gladly take the points, establishing them at the top of the table as the only undefeated team, they will also know that if they are going to have to do better if they are going to stay there. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season4/1105befcvafc.html" target="_blank">more from BEFC...</a><br>
