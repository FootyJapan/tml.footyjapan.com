									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 21st Jan.</b> The Barbs Management Supremo's of Pepe Deslaux, Tricky Dick and Geordie Clarkie were walking out for the Barbs night game under the floodlights at Hachijoji and taken back to that epic encounter between Ali &amp; Foreman back in the 70's, overwhelmed with nostalgia the &quot;rope a dope&quot; game plan was hatched. <br>
										<br>
										The Ali camp consisted of Septic Mike between the sticks, Hideki, Pepe, Pikey Damo, and Martin fog horn legg horn in defense. In midfield were tricky Dick, Muramoto, Geordie Clarke and Leon Yao Ming. Up front were Leck Welensa and Turbo Toshi, with Will and Pepe&nbsp;(Chris) II freezing to death on the bench. <br>
										<br>
										And true to that epic encounter the Barbs found themselves well and truly on  the ropes for the first few rounds, Fog Horn and Pepe clearing off the line, Septic producing some moments for the camera's and a succession of corners to Foreman found the Barbs camped in their own box, it looked like there was only one result on the cards. <br>
										<br>
										Then out over nowhere Geordie Clarke splits the defense with one of his trademark slide rule passes and Turbo Toshi puts the Barbs one nil up much to the amazement of the clash. More toe to &nbsp;toe action ensued, with Yao Ming leaping like a Salmon to prove &quot;white Dwarf's can jump&quot; keeping his heading stats top of the little league and giving the Barbs defense a breather, good work down the flanks from Tricky and Muramoto, but seeing the Clash still keeping the Barbs on the ropes until yet again another incisive counter attack saw the Barbs go into the half time break &nbsp;two nil up courtesy of Muramoro. <br>
										<br>
										Septic &quot; there's one for the camera's&quot; Bell decided to show he is human after all by letting the clash get on the scoresheet only for supersub Pepe II to break clear of the notoriously pedestrian Sid Lloyd and calmly slot home the Barbs third. <br>
										<br>
										More good passing moves from the clash saw them keep the possession stats in their favour but with little end product due to committed team defending by the Barbs who still remained on the ropes until Yao Ming gets his head on the ball again to release Turbo who feeds Pepe II to score the goal of the game with a crashing 20 yarder into Foremans bottom left hand corner. <br>
										<br>
										Great game played in good spirit that the Clash looked like they had in the bag and won't believe they lost, fair to say it was a &quot;rope a dope&quot;. <br>
