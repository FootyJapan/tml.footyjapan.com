									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 27th Jan.</b> What a difference a week makes. More to the point, what a difference waking up before 7 a.m. makes to your yin and your yang.<br>
										BFC were without Pink Neil and Taka but still had enough quality to create some decent chances, although some highly dodgy line calls pulled them up short on three occasions in the first half as they prepared to pull the trigger.<br>
										Evans caused early panic for the French, one cross headed over by Alastair, while skipper Jon Day and Pablo were furious to be blown for offside with the whites of the French goalkeeper's eyes visible.<br>
										BFC's previous clashes against the French have not been for the faint-hearted and, to use the vernacular, France FC were bang up for this one. The BFC were strangely out of sorts, however, slow to the ball and with a dicky radar.<br>
										A needlessly conceded free kick midway through the first half looked innocuous enough but the French number six absolutely battered it from fully 35 metres, the ball swerving manically from left to right before smacking against the BFC's crossbar. A real let-off.<br>
										BFC's game picked up at the start of the second half, right-back Ryo picking out Alastair, whose flicked released Paul Wadsworth. The lodger was dispossessed on the edge of the box but the loose ball fell for Alastair, whose left-foot drive flashed just over.<br>
										There was more from BFC with Jon Day racing clear only for his attempted curled shot to come back off the bar and fall to safety. Evans went close, Shosuke fired over and Leigh Manson blasted over after a marauding run that would have done Braveheart proud.<br>
										Day then found himself in space but failed to get enough purchase on his shot which flew wide, bringing a scream of annoyance from the BFC captain. James Morson, meanwhile, was screaming at the French substitutes, who were calling for yellows with monotonous regularity.<br>
										A surreal exchange then followed with the French full-back calling for a yellow card after a BFC foul. Day then informed referee Simon, 'That's a yellow for asking for a yellow.' You know where I am going with this, right?<br>
										Frustration was setting in and the tackles were coming in thick and fast. Shosuke, being offered little protection from the referee, was clattered from behind for the umpeenth time. Again, no card.<br>
										If ever a game needed a strong referee it was this one. The game was spiralling out of control and it was lucky nobody got seriously injured. As far as the phantom offsides went, Simon's reply that it was 'up to the French to supply whatever linesmen they like' missed the point by as far as some of BFC's passing.<br>
										Jason's successful tryout in goal was a silver lining for BFC, who will hope to have Neil and Taka back for the crunch game against the Swiss next weekend.<br>
