									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 6th May</b>, A very English day met the Swiss as they were to round out the season, rain and a chilly breeze at Saitama Stadium (well, Hachioji Koen) for their final match of the '06-'07 campaign.&nbsp; Hopes of sneaking the title from the British on goal difference were dashed the day before with Sala being well beaten&nbsp;by the BFC, allowing them&nbsp;to claim the championship with a match in hand - well done to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were the strongest throughout the year, consistent recruiting on the part of management meant that player turnover and inavailability were mere speed bumps as they raced to the title.&nbsp; <br>
										<br>
										In spite of this, the 'average' Swiss (based on the Irish reports of the last game) decided to make this last game count to show they deserved 2nd place.&nbsp; The French were clearly missing a few players as well, whether it be to the weather or Golden Week, not much mercy was shown as the Swiss looked sharp from the start.&nbsp; Movement around the back from Koin to Raffa and Andy and Kai was working hard with JP in midfield.&nbsp; Some good through balls found Kirk and Karl open early for some easy chances but Francois did well to keep them out - experience (or age) showed as he stopped well from short range.&nbsp; Though the back line was doing their best, a rather silly goal ended up breaking open the flood gates.&nbsp; <br>
										JP sent in a cross from the left side, high enough for Kirk just to get a nod on it.&nbsp; He sent it high across the goal and Francois back pedaled but could only tip it into the net, 1-0 to the Swiss.&nbsp; After that, the waves of attacks came from both sides with Aoki and Koi sending in balls from the right while Miles and Andy were coming up the left.&nbsp; Kai and JP were solid getting up and down the field as well.&nbsp; The French got forward occasionally with Nacer and one of their Japanese players taking people on but the Swiss had numbers in defence and made it tough.&nbsp; Kirk would eventually get a one on one opportunity vs. Francois to make it 2-0 and then from a nice cross from Koi, he volleyed in make it 3-0.&nbsp; The first half ended that way.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At the start of the second half, the French sounded as if they were going to try and raise the bar but that was not going to be the case.&nbsp; With&nbsp;8 minutes gone,&nbsp;Ogata sent Kirk away for another one on one which Francois blocked up into the air only for Kirk to follow it up with a header into an open net.&nbsp; 5 minutes later, Kai broke down the&nbsp;right side and sent in a perfect ball for Kirk to blast home for his 5th on the day.&nbsp; The French started to carry the ball forward out of midfield better but the strikers were not&nbsp;providing options and the midfielders had to shoot from too far away or they were disposessed as the swarming Swiss defence closed them down.&nbsp; They were also guilty of some poor shooting with 2 or 3 chances shot wide when inside the box.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Swiss ended up closing the scoring with a nice one on one finish by Miles and then a great piece of passing and dribbiling by Ogata as&nbsp;he passed into&nbsp;an open net.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Swiss finished the year strongly but it was a little too late as some silly losses (and draws)&nbsp;early on meant we gave ourselves little chance of catching the league winners.&nbsp; &nbsp;Well done to the BFC but the Swiss leave the other teams with something to think about with 16 goals for vs. 2 against in their last 4 games.&nbsp; Well done boys and we can only look forward to next year.<br>
