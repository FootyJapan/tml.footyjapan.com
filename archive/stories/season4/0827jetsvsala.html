								<p><b>OiFuto Dai Ni, Sun 27th August.</b> The Saitama Jets picked up right where they left off after their promotion to Division 1, with a convincing win against a strong Sala team.  Under the flood lights of Oi-Futo-Dai-Ni field on the newly renovated pitch, the Jets wasted no time in making their presence felt.  Within the first two passes the ball found Ryan Loren, a quick move around a Sala defender and he was down the sideline uncovered.  He cut back into the 18 yard box and threaded the needle to South African, Ryan Botta, the newest member of the Jets.  Botta slid and converted for his first goal of the season...a nice Ryan-to-Ryan connection.  Jets 1 - 0 after 30 seconds.<br>
									<br>
									The pace was definitely in favor of Saitama in the first half and with passes from Capt. Mark Eite to an overlapping Nate Gildart down the right side. Gildart made a couple nice moves and found a wide open Loren at top of the box.  One touch to settle the ball and another to finish off his first goal of the new TML season.  Jets 2 - 0 at half!<br>
									<br>
									Sala would not go away, and they were a very determined side in the second half controlling much of the first 20 + minutes.  The Jets defense of Jon Rayner, Tomo Kobayashi, Mike Passmore, &amp; Yasu weathered the storm nicely.  However, a relatively easy shot on goal which Jets keeper Kosuke Harada normally handles was misplayed, and deflected out of bounds.  The ensuing corner kick was initially cleared, but Big Number 5 &quot;Guido&quot; of Sala rebounded and finished in the upper left hand corner for Sala's first goal.  2 - 1 with time to play.<br>
									<br>
									Substitute players Simone, Shimuzu, Hide, Masato, and Chris Piper provided some fresh legs and balanced out the ongoing attack of Sala.  With just a few minutes left to play Simone went into his bag-of-tricks, and weaved in and out of Sala defenders before leaving the ball off for Kobayashi who knocked one into the back of the net for a 3 - 1 lead, and ultimately solidifying the win.  A great team effort, and a great win, for the Saitama Jets who are determined to prove they belong in Division 1.<b><br>
