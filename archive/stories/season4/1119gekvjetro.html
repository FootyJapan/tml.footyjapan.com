									<br>
									The game started in  the same manner as the weather conditions and it took a surprise  counter attack to rudely awaken the sleepy Geckoes. Jetro broke  quickly and their sprightly winger found the head of Kobayashi  leaving WSG 1-0 down and facing another humiliating defeat for the  2nd time this season. <br>
									<br>
									The introduction of Gino Dilberto into the  middle of the park provided some much needed bite but poor finishing  kept the scores level going into the break. After a stern bollocking  from &quot;Rob Manager&quot; the Geckoes started the 2nd half with a much- improved attitude and it was not long after the restart that Kaz laid  of a lovely ball to new boy Paul James who made no mistake with the  finish bringing WSG back into the game. <br>
									<br>
									Soon after Kaz was involved  again, this time bagging a goal of his own after a lovely side step  that left him clear in the 18yard box with just the keeper to beat,  2-1 WSG. <img src="../../../mats/photos/06/1119gekvjetro3.jpg" alt="" height="245" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="3"><br>
									<br>
									There then followed one of the most controversial penalty in TML history, unusually this time not the result of a dubious  refereeing decision. (Quentin himself looked confused for a couple of  seconds). For whatever reason, a Jetro defender decided to simply  catch the ball in the 18yard box from a seemingly innocuous cross,  leaving every player on the park (except the catcher) wondering what  on earth was going on. Quentin had no choice but to award a penalty  for sheer stupidity and Mikel Troen stepped up to slot home from the  spot. <br>
									<br>
									Simply surreal.<br>
