								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 5th Nov.</b> Well, a wins a win, 3 points is 3 points, you get 1 more goal than them and you get the win and the 3 points. YCAC did exactly that and no more against the Swiss on Sunday. What else do you need to know?<br>
									<br>
									OK, the YCAC reserves are miles better than the Swiss reserves, Peter Pauli is still a decent keeper or the Swiss would have been looking at a defeat of Hibs like proportions. Damian Hart is still a rock solid defender or YCAC might have conspired to throw away a game they dominated and seemed to have won even before the Swiss squad got to the ground. So, 1-0 to the YCAC, scorer Gav, assists to Anthony the Fish and an unknown Swiss defender.<br>
									<br>
									More? I'm struggling here because this was an instantly forgettable game. The Swiss were without Kirk, Dave Pratt and Dale. Maybe others, I dont know. YCAC countered by carelessly losing Gary the Goalie, Kev, Nick and Daisuke to various spurious excuses. YCAC were also missing&nbsp; ex Japan skipper Nakata. He hasnt played before though and isnt really likely to in the future so perhaps we shouldnt use him as an excuse. Still, his absence obviously was a blow. You can't deny that&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									YCAC may or may not have cared less about 1 or 2 of their absentees, I'm not saying here, but the Swiss were certainly a pale shadow of their usual selves and seemed to have accepted that a good shoeing was coming even before the 1st whistle. Nobody ever gets thrashed by YCAC though, not 2nd division teams in the cup, not relegation certainies, nobody. Certainly not the Swiss. So it was a 1-0 win and 3 points. 3 wins on the bounce with a grand total of 4 goals scored. Good if you like grey hairs, less so if long fingernails are your thing<br>
									<br>
									<b>MOM, Peter Pauli. Well done Peter. You win an Aston Martin. Sorry it couldnt be something a little less common but money is tight.</b> <br>
