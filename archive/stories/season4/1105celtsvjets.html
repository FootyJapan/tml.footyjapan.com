								<p><b>Misato, Sun 5th Nov.</b> Another disappointing Misato Sunday morning for the Celts. Against the old rivals Saitama Jets, as they slumped to their 3rd consecutive defeat. <br>
									After the high of the opening day victory over the French, the Celts have since struggled, scoring just one goal in over 240 minutes of football - and that a rebound from a penalty. Sundays game never really looked like adding to that, not being helped by the absence of 4 strikers for various reasons forcing the management to use 2 wide midfielders up front. Throughout the game the Celts lacked a cutting edge and while midfield and the makeshift strikeforce of Roberto &amp; Jeremiah worked hard, the lack of cutting edge was evident. However a number of good set piece positions squandered by putting the ball directly out of play and a lack of movement hardly helped the cause. Towards the end of the half the Jets squandered a couple of decent opportunities, both originating from crosses from the right hand side. Only the Jets forwards could tell you how they managed not to score at least one of them. Half time 0-0. <br>
									At half time the Celts reorganised midfield, and brought some joy in the first 10 minutes. Jets almost scored when they broke through with the striker 1-on1 with the keeper, but Aki managed to get a strong hand on it to turn it onto the post with a great save. However, minutes later a somewhat harsh free kick and a lapse in concentration at the back allowed Sasaki to steal in and knock the ball past Aki in the Celts goal in the 55th minute. The Celts again pressed, without creating any real opportunities to trouble the Jets keeper, and disaster struck when Aki who had an uncharacteristically rushed out of his area and missed the ball a couple of times earlier was beaten to the ball again, and Sasaki was once again availing of a gift from the Celts. <br>
									Game ended 2-0 and was probably a fair result based on chances created. <br>
									Good performances from Damo &amp; Mark were the highlight but with the games coming thick and fast, improvement and a couple of strikers are required for the Celts.<br>
