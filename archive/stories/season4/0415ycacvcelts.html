										<br>
										<b>YCAC Ready Made Excuse List</b></p>
									<ol>
										<li>Horrible Surface. Check but same for both etc and YCAC should be used to that by now
										<li>Missing players. Check but Celts only had the bare XI (including a rather sheepish looking YCAC 2s player)
										<li>Inclement Weather. Nope, beautiful day if a little windy
										<li>Crap Ref. Nope. One of the best.
										<li>Lack of incentive. Hopefully not. A victory would have taken YCAC top, albeit&nbsp;only until BFC had played their games in hand
										<li>Bad luck. only that it hadn't poured with rain all weekend causing flooding in Misato
										<li>The other team were better. Check. Kitajima, Damo and new boy Kaji can hold their heads up. The rest of us were distinctly inferior to our Celts opposite numbers on the day
									</ol>
									<p>The uninformed observer would not have been surprised to learn that 1 team was 2nd from top and the other 2nd from bottom with a whopping 25 points seperating them at KO. They just would have got it the wrong way around.<br>
