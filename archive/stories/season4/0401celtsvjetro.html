									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 1st April</b>, Having fought so hard to gain a valuable point agains the Hibs a week earlier, Celts headed to a meeting with Jetro with confidence that we could break out of the bottom 2 with a victory. The game started well with a series of attacks repelled by last ditch Jetro defending and at least one good save from the keeper. <br>
										So was causing all sorts of problems up front, and was lucky to have his jersey in one piece by the time the game finished, being the victim of several shirt pulling incidents. In fact he was amazingly booked a full 40 minutes before anyone fouling him was, an unlucky card for going in with studs up, despite looking the other way and attempting to play the ball. <br>
										Celts took a deserved lead when Jetro failed to clear a corner, Marcs shot was well saved by the keeper but So was on hand to score his first of the season.<br>
										Celts were in complete control at this stage, with Jetro yet to mount a meaningful attack. This was in part due to the action-man like display from Libor at the back, winning multiple headers over the course of the game and at one stage jumping to chest the ball down from above the head of the Jetro striker. <br>
										Against the run of play Jetro equalized when an innocuous situation turned to disaster as Paddy stumbled attempting to play a backpass to Aki. The pass was underhit and with Aki stranded the Jetro striker nipped in to finish to an empty net. Half time 1-1. <br>
										<br>
										Second half started much like the first with Celts again applying pressure. Libor capped his man of the match display when after a scramble around the box, the ball dropped and he slammed home from 8 yards. Celts remained in complete control, and pushed on looking to get a 3rd goal to kill the game off. <br>
										Disaster again struck with just over 15 minutes remaining when an shot from 30 yards which Aki looked to have covered moved in the air, and slipped in.<br>
										Amazingly with 5 minutes to go Jetro struck again. A corner not properly dealt with and slotted to an empty net. <br>
										A 3-2 defeat extremely hard to take, especially given that Jetro had a total of 4 shots in the game and that all 3 goals conceded were very preventable.<br>
										On the plus side, Celts still have games in hand and must play all the teams around them again, so all in our own hands, starting next Sunday again old rivals Saitama Jets.<br>
