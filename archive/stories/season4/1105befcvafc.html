								<p><b>Misato, Sun 12th Nov.</b> They say that it&rsquo;s a mark of a good team when they can not play well and still win.  Well it must also be a sign of something else because The Embassy managed to sneak away from Misato last Sunday with all three points despite being second best for large periods of what was, for the most part, a third rate game.  While the Embassy will gladly take the points, establishing them at the top of the table as the only undefeated team, they will also know that if they are going to have to do better if they are going to stay there.<br>
									<br>
									For the most part it was a messy affair with neither side showing any real inclination to play anything resembling a controlled, passing game.  While the AFC Wanderers seemed to favour running at the Embassy defense, the Embassy seemed to adopt a policy of ignoring the crowded midfield entirely when going forward and instead lobed endless balls over the top for Steve &ldquo;Crouchie&rdquo; Lidbury, he of the lethal left foot and seemingly boundless reserve of energy, to chase.  Most of these long balls were, predictably, lost causes.  However, I am obliged, under captains orders, to mention that what seemed to most on the pitch as a particularly overly hit clearance by Tim Letheren was in fact a beautifully weighted ball that could well have brought about the opening goal had the opposition&rsquo;s defense not been to quick to react.  Of the two rather shoddy tactics it was the Embassy&rsquo;s that paid off.  While the AFC&rsquo;s pacey and highly skillful winger seemed to breeze through the Embassy&rsquo;s ranks like &#x2026; (what is that idiom about hot knives and butter?) the end product was never coming- whereas at the other end one particular long ball did finally fall right and Steve left the keeper with no chance.<br>
									<br>
									At some point around the opening goal the Embassy had to make the first of three forced substitutions as Gerard Brady had to leave the pitch due to a self inflicted injury (an all night session in Roppongi).  After a particularly energetic tracking run back the stand-in central defender stopped, bent double, yawned twice &#150; in full Technicolor &#150; and that was that.  And while talking of forced substitutions a mention must be made to Rob Horsfield who, upon making his season&rsquo;s debut &lsquo;took one for the team&rsquo; leaping for a crucial defensive header.  While he got all of the ball, his opponent got all of his head and that was, again, that.  The third and final forced substitution (and one that will could well bode particularly badly for the Embassy&rsquo;s campaign) occurred midway through the second half when the Argentine master who is Ferdy pulled up with a problem somewhere near his nuts (maybe a groin strain? Ed)  As he limped off someone shouted at him to hurry up, to which Ferdy politely pointed out that if he could run he wouldn&rsquo;t be leaving the pitch.  He then said something in Spanish, which I believe translates as, &ldquo;as you can see, my good man&rdquo;.<br>
									<br>
									Anyhow, back to the action.  Well, the game.  In the absence of any decent football to distract the players&rsquo; tempers, handbags did threaten to fly and the referee did a great job of keeping a lid on proceedings in a valiant attempt to let the flow of the game continue&#x2026;(?)  And so as half time arrived and the Embassy went in a goal to the good, it was with heavy irony that Will the Barman asked, over fags and orange quarters, if there was any negatives to be taken from the half&rsquo;s play.<br>
									<br>
									 The second half was, predictably, much the same as the first with, if anything, the Wanderer&rsquo;s having the better of the play.  Had their attacks had the final cutting edge then things may well have been different.  However, as in the first half, the Embassy did a great job of getting men behind the ball when under threat.  And while this led to some &lsquo;ping pong&rsquo; like defending at times, ultimately it was enough to keep a clean sheet.  The Wanderer&rsquo;s key threat &#150; the pacy winger &#150; was identified, man marked and double-teamed (and once or twice fouled &#150; sorry) whenever possible.  The one time the Wanderers did manage to get a clean shot off on target it was met with a fine save from Keith, tipping the fierce drive over the bar.  And perhaps this here is the point.  This was a game that the Embassy would probably have lost last year.  But these days, without playing well the Embassy is doing a better job of the basics.  There is no lack of effort, the defending is done in numbers and resiliently, and going forward there is a cutting edge that was lacking in the past.  <br>
									<br>
									And it was that cutting edge that finally ended the game as a contest.  Against the run of play the ball again found it&rsquo;s way into the back of the Wanderer&rsquo;s goal.  Forwards Steve and Alex combined well and when the resulting shot was well saved by the keeper the rebound fell to Kotaro who made no mistake.  A goal we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have scored last year.  And so while the result did flatter the Embassy it has to be said that, whilst not pretty, the game was won.  Grit, resilience, and plenty of effort.  Like they say, it&rsquo;s a mark of a half decent second division Sunday league team when you can not play well and still take home three points.<br>
									<br>
									<b>Man of the Match: Will the Barman</b><br>
									<br>
									A typically battling performance that summed up the Embassy&rsquo;s best qualities, full of commitment, heart and the occasional well played pass.  (This honour is bestowed upon Will despite the fact that he clattered into his own players &#150; especially me &#150; as much as he did the opposition.) <br>
