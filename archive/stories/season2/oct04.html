					<p><b>YC&amp;AC and Nodai, 30th Oct, 2004.</b> All 7 league matches went ahead, despite constant rain that would have normally cancelled matches. At YC&amp;AC 5 matches were played back to back with little deterioration whereas at Nodai, the conditions by the end of the 2nd match were more akin to a mud bath. Late kick-offs at both locations also meant the final games were completed in semi-darkness, lending to some very contested decisions.<br>
						An early start for Swiss Kickers and the British Embassy saw the newly promoted team taking the lead over the team at the top right now. The Embassy couldn't hold out though and the relentless pressure of the Swiss prevailed as usual as they swept their way to a 4-1 victory. Hibs left it until late in their match to secure all the points against a determined Maritizio squad. 2 goals near the end were enough to keep Hibs on level points with the Swiss but having played an extra match.<br>
						The 3rd match was another close battle, this time in Div 2 between Barbarians and KGFC. A goal in each half for KGFC were enough to maintain KGFC's perfect record and keep them on the heels of the Dutch Embassy.<br>
						It was another bad weekend for YC&amp;AC's home teams, the 1st team losing 2-1 to Wallstreet Geckoes after having been in the lead and then the 2nd team was pounded by Dutch Embassy, 8-0 with So Takada scoring 4. This takes his Tally to 9 from just 4 matches while the team heads the table.<br>
						The scenes at Nodai were laughable (if you saw it from a distance rather han being involved) as Saitama JETs waited, kitted, in their cars, while Vagabonds tried to get changed under umbrellas in driving rain. Once underway, JETs adapted better to the slippery conditions and snatched a winner in the 2nd half. With the surface rapidly turning into mud, penalties were awarded but missed at both ends but led to an exciting finish.<br>

						The fastest ever goal in TML was scored by BFC in their muddy goalfest with Jetro FC. With just the 3rd or 4th kick of the ball, Tomomitsu Kunii's cross/shot skidded/bounced awkwardly past the Jetro keeper to make it 1-0 after just 10~15 seconds. In horrible conditions and low light the teams fought out an epic 4-4 battle with some great goals and 3 penalties<br>
						<b>ed</b><br>
						<b class=red>&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;.</b><br>
						Those of us mad enough to play in the baking July heat on the arid waste of Oi Futo or the melting astro of St Marys were probably dreaming of such conditions as we had at YCAC on Saturday afternoon.<br>
						The wind, rain and mud didn't do YCAC much good, though. Wall St Geckoes style of play was much more suited to the conditions and they ran out 2-1 winners to leave YCAC pointless after 2 games<br>
						After Tony Hopwoods pinpoint header from a Phil Denham freekick had given them a HT lead, YCAC had more than enough of the ball to have gone on and put the game away but 2 minutes of madness cost them dear. Attacking deep in the WSG half the ball was carelessly given away and switched immediately to the YCAC penalty area. A neat back heel put the ball directly into the path of the centre forward who finished with aplomb&nbsp; off the post. Very quickly afterwards, a scrambled goal from a corner which the YCAC defence failed to clear gave WSG the lead which they never really looked like losing again.&nbsp;<br>
						The lone spectator went home, wet, cold and disappointed<br>

				<td><h2 class=blue>HECTIC WEEKEND, LOTS OF CARDS</h2>
				<P><b>OiFuto, 23rd Oct, 2004.</b> A total of 11 matches were organized by TML this weekend, all of which survived thanks 
				to Typhoon #23 blowing through mid week and not lingering. Hibs joined Swiss on 9 points after beating BFC 1-0, France and Sala both moved up with nice victories while JETRO both their 1st points after a nil, nil draw with Geckoes.<BR>
				The 2nd division saw 4 players being red carded for various offences, 3 in the match between Celts and KGFC that ended in a 2-1 win for KGFC. Dutch Embassy consolidated their lead at the head of Div 2 with a 5-4 win over Yokota United -
				So Takada bagging himself a hattrick. YC&amp;AC finally joined the action on Sunday, their 1st XI being well beaten by Sala, while their 2nd XI grabbed a point when Clash let them in with a last minute equalizer for 3-3!<BR>

					<p>St Mary's, 23rd October. Hibs beat the BFC 1-0 in a closely-fought encounter on Saturday. Mick O'Hagen got on the end of a nicely-weighted through ball and nicked the ball over Sid in the BFC goal late in the second half to snatch all three points. Ryo Yasunaga and Bevan Colless had both impressed in their central defender roles, in a game of few chances where both defences dominated. Henrik Astrom had also stood out on his BFC debut, often finding time and space in the midst of an intense midfield battle that saw Mark Kouyias limp off with a badly damaged ankle. We wish him a speedy recovery.<br>

						<b class=red>Jets do repeat over Nova.</b><br>
						It was deja vu time at Ina, as, just as in the first TML season, the Saitama Jets beat NOVA by four goals to two. The Jets raced into a 3-0 lead, with captain Mark Eite's opener followed up by two goals by Ryan Loren. A defensive mixup then allowed NOVA to pull a goal back before half-time. Calvin Ogata restored the Jets' 3-goal lead midway through the second half, before NOVA again fought back to make it 4-2.<br>

						<b class=red>10 man AFC beat Shane FC in five goal thriller.</b><br>
						AFC Wanderers got their first win of the season with a 3-2 win over Shane FC. In an exciting match, AFC Wanderers took the lead through Jeremy Wickremer, who nicely finished a good move after 20 minutes. AFC had a player sent off just before half-timefor deliberate handball on the goal line and Shane's No.10 blasted the ball home from the spot. In the second half, Shane took the lead early and with the extra man, their No.9 beating the offside trap and slotting the ball home. The Wanderers re-found their scoring touch a quarter of an hour before the end with Jeremy Wickremer again nicely finishing a Wanderers move. It looked like it was going to end 2-2 until the last minute when a penalty was awarded for a foul in the box and Mark Stevenson stepped up for the Wanderers and tucked the spot kick into the bottom left hand corner. A good result for AFC and Shane very unlucky to come away empty-handed.<br>

						After Oliver Worsfold put France FC ahead from a freekick, with the aid of a slight deflection, early in the first half a rout was on the cards. Instead, Maritzio shut up shop and even scored a fantastic equalising goal in the second half, with their only shot of the game, after a sweeping move down the pitch. France FC did not panic and showed great determination to ride this setback and Nicolas Bozzi scored his first, then his second for the club in the last 10 mins. The final score of 3-1 to France FC was fully merited despite a dogged display from Maritzio.<br>

						<b class=red>Lots of work to do for YC&amp;AC</b><br>
						&quot;Its a game of 3 halves&quot; or at least it was on Sunday lunch-time at sunny YCAC. Unfortunately for YCAC, Sala dominated the 1st period and shaded the 3rd, scoring twice in both. YCAC had its purple patch for a 25 minute period either side of Half-Time but could only manage 1 goal, a fine individual effort from Joe Takeda. YCAC could only manage to field 3 from last years team and the&nbsp;resulting lack of cohesion was ably exploited by Sala's pin point delivery from corners and free kicks. 2 early goals resulted. After initial shakiness the YCAC back 3 matched the solid performance of the Sala defence and chances were few and far between. Sala snatched 2 well worked goals at the end as YCAC pushed forward looking for a point to round out a deserved victory. A good game reffed well by Quentin.<br>

					<p><b>Ueno Gakuin, 17th Oct, 2004.</b> Beautiful sunshine set the scene for the 22nd Scottish Highland Games in Soka City with around one and a half housand people there on the day. As usual the 5-a-side football, organized again by <a href="http://www.footyjapan.com" target="_blank">Footy Japan</a>, attracted a huge following, with 23 teams competing in the 1066 Cup &amp; masters Cup.<br>
						Last Year the Final was won by Sala FC defeating KFC 3-1 in the 1066 Cup. This year the final was between the same 2 teams, but KFC took it with a 4-1 victory in yet another tough battle between 2 fierce competitors.<br>
						The Masters tournament saw the introduction of female players for the first time, Onnabelievable FC, who managed a draw putting them 3rd in their group. The final was an all British affair between BFC Masters &amp; BFC Vagabonds Masters; all of whom play regularly together as an 11 a side team. No punches were pulled though and the very even match was decided by one of the all time dodgiest goals ever given. The referee must have been using his 1966 Russin goggles to award the Vags masters a goal after a fine save from Gus 'the cat', but wouldn't budge on his decision despite pleas &amp; groans from the sideline. Video footage is not conclusive, but the cameraman is holding out for more money before handing over the tape to any of the BFC. Still the goal stood and Vags Masters won 2-1, leading to some heated discussions over copious amounts of beer later!<br>

				<P><b>Nodai, 16th Oct, 2004.</b> Yokota United came back from a 2-0 deficit to beat Barbarians 4-2 in their Division 2 match. Barbarians had got off to a flying start, when Fred Delsaux scored in the 2nd minute and Onuma followed with 
				the 2nd after 15 mins. Yokota pulled one back before the break through Lee Hoover then in the 2nd half took the match with goals from Guy Hayes, Fits Jaeger &amp; Tim Fearney. This puts them in pole position with 7 points from their 3 matches 
				so far.<BR>
				Wallstreet Geckoes showed the kind of form that helped them beat Swiss in the cup last year, pummelling Maritizio 5-0.<BR> After taking a quick 2-0 lead, by half-time Geckoes were well in control at 3-0. New signing Kazu, described 
				by the captain as being simply 'Awesome', scored a hattrick along the way. This result brings Geckoes up to 4th position but there's a long way to go yet!<BR>

				the fixture calendar, but also meant the introduction of the new match ball will have to wait until next weekend. This season we've decided to go with a slightly heavier ball and <a href="http://www.PUMA.com/" target="_blank">

				as they met at 9:00am on Saturday morning. Both teams moved the ball around well in the midfield but it was always the Swiss who looked most threatening up-front with striker Ian hungry for more goals.<BR>
				The deadlock was broken late in the 1st half, when a diagonal through ball beat the Hibs offside trap &amp; Ian Brown-Peterside found himself 1 on 1 with the keeper. Despite his initial effort being blocked, Ian finished with 
				the 2nd attempt to take Swiss 1-0 ahead before the break.<BR>
				The 2nd half was more of the same tough battling, but was marred when Swiss midfielder Kawakubo was dismissed for spitting on an opponent and then had a tantrum on the way off the pitch, leaving his teammates feeling embarrassed 
				&amp; angry. It didn't seem to effect their game though, as they went on to win a penalty that was dispatched once again by Ian Brown-Peterside. Hibs could gfind no answer to the Swiss, with Captain Kirk keeping the likes of Narama, 
				Thomas &amp; Colless at bay. Kirk paid the price in the end though, with one of his Challenges for a header resulting in him being decked, falling on his elbow and breaking it. This will sideline the Swiss' inspirational American for 
				6 weeks or more.

As Vagabonds tried to reply, midfielder Joel hit the underside of the cross bar before on loan striker Norm Collins brought them level with a 90th minute penalty. The referee dubiously awarded a spot kick for a challenge on Hiro as he went down trying to wriggle his way through to goal.<br>
						Ageless defender, Ged O'connell was substituted late on for his own protection really, after taking 2 heavy blows to the head in challenges. Despite the ref stating FIFA rules concerning head injuries, Ged almost had to be dragged off screaming he was fine to play(if somewhat battered &amp; bruised.<br>
						This really was a Jekyll &amp; Hyde performance from the Vagabonds, while Yokota must surely feel aggrieved at dropping two valuable points.<br>
