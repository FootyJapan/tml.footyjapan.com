				<td><h1 class=blue>SWISS NO MATCH FOR MAN U.</h1>
				<p><b>Sat 28th May,</b> KFC and YCAC had teams down at the Hong Kong 7's tournament.  KFC Tokyo, which was made up of members from the Swiss, Hibs, and YCAC played in the main competition while YCAC with members from the Swiss and YCAC played in the veterans competition.  KFC was grouped with the Urawa Reds, Manchester United, and an All-Star team from Hong Kong's amateur league.  The YCAC was grouped with Middlesborough (Gary Pallister and Tony Woodcock), the Footballers Channel from the UK, and a local club from Hong Kong.  
	<BR>KFC went down 2-0 to both of the pro sides and tied the Yau Yee Select team to end up 4th in the group and drop down to the plate.  YCAC drew against both of the ex-pro teams and beat the local team 1-0 to advanced to the Cup competition.  The following day, YCAC went down 1-0 in the first game of the Cup to the Hong Kong Football Club to go out of the competition.  KFC drew with a local pro-side and won on penalties following a nice save by Hitoshi from the Hibs.  In the second game, KFC played local pro-side Kitchee and had a chance to win 2-1 but missed a penalty and ended up going down 3-1 in the closing minutes.  
	<BR>Great tournament which Urawa ended up winning by beating PSV Eindhoven in the main Cup final 3-0.  The German All-Stars (with Uwe Bein and Rumminegge) beat up on the British ex-Pros 3-0 (John Beresford, Barton, Bolder in goal) in the veterans final.

					<p><b>Sat 28th May,</b> On a hot and humid day at Ina, middle of nowhere (a.k.a. Ina Saitama), a mid-table TML Division one clash between Sala and FranceFC would hopefully go some way to clear the table's minor placings behind the inevitable Swiss and Hibs. France FC should have opened the scoring when presented with a couple of easy chances in the first five minutes but then the Sala midfield perked up and the French can consider themselves lucky to come away with a 2-2 draw after Sala dominated most of the game.<br>
						The opening Sala goal, after about 15mins, was a well taken effort from the Sala striker, Dhugal Beddingfield, when he beat the FranceFC offside trap with a perfectly timed run onto a nice defense splitting pass from the centre of the park. The second Sala goal, 10mins into the second half, came after a sweet cross from the right eluded the French goalie and was volleyed in with aplomb by the onrushing Sala striker. Sala then had a number of chances to kill the game off but failed to take them.<br>
						The FranceFC comeback was startling as it was lightning. With less than five minutes to go the FranceFC midfield picked up the pace and after crashing a shot against the bar and missing one or two sitters the FranceFC midfielders worked a fine move down their left hand side and the resulting cross was volleyed in at the back stick by Olly Worsfold. The FranceFC equalizer came after more great work from the French midfield and a back headed goal from Etsushi Yoshikoshi into the open net left the Sala team stunned. With less than 30 seconds to go the FranceFC team could have even won the game but it was not to be and would have quite frankly been harsh on Sala. The final 2-2 score left both teams disappointed because FranceFC needed the win to climb the table and Sala were naturally gutted after letting slip a game they had dominated for about 70minutes.<br>
						<b>OW</b><br>
						<b class=blue>Another French lesson for Sala.</b><br>
						Two nil up and cruising to a straightforward win over France, Sala pushed the self-destruct button in the last two minutes and felt like the losing team coming off the pitch.<br>

					<p>Now that the Champions have been decided, the Swiss vs Hibs final league match was of no consequence except good preparation for their coming Semi-Final Cup match. Swiss beat their close rivals 1-0 at St. Marys in a closely contested match but the real test will come when they meet at the same place in the cup on June 4th. Swiss, current FC Cup holders and New league Champions will hope to do the double this year, but arch rivals &amp; last years league Champions Tokyo Hibernian will not give up easily. If you're in the area, 'Don't miss this match', it'll be a corker!<br>
						In the 2nd Division, Kanto Celts &amp; Vagabonds FC finished this years league campaign on a high, both teams coming back from a 1 goal deficit to win. Vagabonds dominated a 10 man Shane squad, scoring a goal in each half to win the match 2-1. <a href="http://www.bfctokyo.com" target="_blank">more...</a> Celts needed a 2nd half revival after going into the break 1-0 down against Dutch Embassy Team, and what a revival it was. 5 goals secured them a nice victory while the Dutch were left to ponder what had happened to their season after such a great start!<br>
						Geckoes once again found themselves lacking in key areas and were punished by the 'fighting for survival' JETRO FC. JETRO are now almost certain to stay in Div 1 leaving BEFC &amp; Maritizio to take the fall. BEFC are still clinging on to hope though, as mathematically it's still possible for them to stay up and with them to face JETRO in their final game........<br>

					<p><b>Sun 1st May,</b> Pressure time at Oifuto on the first day of Golden Week. The Swiss and Hibs were going down to the wire to determine this year's champion and the Swiss could take a giant step to the title with a win over the French due to their superior goal difference. Sid, the league organizer, was doing his best to build up the French confidence and possibly even a payoff was in the cards for an upset but the Swiss weren't up for it. The Swiss came out with a 4-4-2 while the French also were going defensive with only 1 man up front.<br>
						It was a somewhat stale first 20 minutes with both teams fighting in midfield and only the occasional long ball seeming to open things up. Unfortunately for the Swiss, a few open chances were left wanting due to poor finishing from Kirk, among others, and the frustration was starting to show again. What changed the flow was a great run from Dave Pratt from midfield, beating 2 defenders to get into the box, and coolly crossing for Karl to bang in from 8 meters out. It was a classic center midfielder's run, shaking off the challenges with power and speed, it was great to see.<br>
						1-0 to the Swiss seemed to take some pressure off them but the French seemed to raise their game a bit. They started connecting passes better in midfield and seemed to get off a few shots from distance. About 8 minutes after the Swiss goal, a weak header into the area which Kirk could only head backwards, led to some confusion between the keeper and the defense. In slipped one of the French forwards who acrobatically shot it from the end-line and into the goal, past the on-rushing Swiss Keeper. It was poor defending but a well taken goal and full credit to the forward.<br>
						The Swiss seemed to realize what was at stake again and raised the level once again - sharper passing and tougher tackling meant some tough calls for the referee but some solid wins in midfield. The French were able to get some shots from distance but Uchida was able to save them well. Going the other way, there was nothing the French could do when a long ball from Kirk found Mori in space on the left hand side, he beat one defender and fired in a left footed shot from the top of the box. The keeper got a hand to it but it still snuck inside the right hand post. 2-1 to the Swiss as we came to the end of the first half.<br>
						The Swiss made a few changes at the beginning of the 2nd half, with Mori and Aoki coming up front. The French made some changes as well by pushing another man forward to try and get the tying goal. This opened things up and the Swiss at the beginning of the half had many chances, Mori had an open shot following a nice 1-2 move with Aoki while JP had a curling volley come off the cross bar. Krando and Kai started to overlap more and it was some nice football.<br>
						Unfortunately, the French defense held up and the Swiss couldn't score the third goal. More player changes for the Swiss meant the rhythm started to change somewhat and they couldn't hold onto the ball. Instead, there were some dangerous counter attacks for the French and some free kicks outside the area following some tough tackles by Dierk and the two Daves in midfield. The tension was evident till the end with the Swiss barely holding on as woeful finishing in front of goal (Angelo and Karlalong with Yuji) and the dangerous French forwards always threatening making it interesting.<br>
						Things boiled over a little at the end with the two Daves and Dierk getting into it with one of the French players but as Dave Pratt said well, &quot;You came for a football game, didn't you?&quot; A little bit untypical of the Swiss but every team needs a little extra when fighting for the title and the Swiss showed that on the day. Well done to the French who made it a very tough game.<br>

					<p><b class="red">HIBS HELD BACK BY BFC.</b><br>
						After the Swiss had beaten France earlier in the day, the TML title all but decided as the Swiss' superior goal difference meant the Hibs required a 10-0 victory to stay in the hunt. However considering the Irish V English and Hibs Vs BFC history; both teams desperately wanted to win this game.<br>
						The Hibs dominated possession and field position right from the kick off, and Hitoshi could have smoked a cigar or two without interruption before half time. Conversely Sid in the BFC goal was on the job throughout the early exchanges. Within the first 30 minutes the Hibs had two strong penalty appeals turned down by Ricky the Ref; one for handball - where the ball did hit the BFC player's hand, with the arm a long way from the side of the body, and the second against BFC midfielder Pablo Pomares who charged into Bevan inside the box getting a big piece of his leg, with Ricky considering the PK before waving play on. Midway through the first half and long range Kuni H free kick found Bevan's head and he knocked it down to Keita who controlled with a great first touch and shot with pace from 14 yards. Sid somehow saved it ( I don't think he knew much about it), but the impact of the speeding ball on his body left him clutching his lower back and running to the subs bench in search of the Tokyo Physio phone number. The scores remained 0-0 at half time.<br>
						BFC came out stronger and more physical in the second half, with some burly midfielders ready to play tough. Tetsu and Yasu were forced to pay for their speed in 50/50 challenges as they ended up with swollen shins and bloody noses respectively as the end result.<br>
						20 minutes from time and BFC had their best chance of the game, as a nice build up on the right saw Evans put a great ball through to the back post, but it flew past the post with attackers 10 yards off the place. Late in the second half the Hibs had two very good chances to win the game, with Yasu threading through a perfect ball for Mitsu who was unable to get a foot on it when the keeper was committed, and Kuni K was released following some smart work by Keita, and he shot well from 10 yards but the ball somehow missed the back post when everyone thought it was going in.<br>
						0-0 it remained until the end and the 2nd TML title goes to the Swiss.<br>

					<p><b class="blue">SALA IN MIGHTY COMEBACK</b><br>
						A blustery day down by the river, saw Sala give Jetro a 2 goal head start as a true test of their fighting qualities. Quite literally from the kick off, Sala, were dispossessed, and then stood and watched as Jetro played a neat one two on the edge of the box, allowing their striker space to dink the ball over Andy Cross. As Sala tried to figure out what was going on, Jetro went about the business of doubling the scoreline. From fully thirty five yards, a Jetro midfielder thumped a shot in off the angle of post and bar, a superb strike.<br>
						Tensions began showing in the Sala team immediately and it seemed for a time that they may self destruct. But fortune favours the brave, and as Sala pushed forward a nice through ball from Shigeru found Toby in space. With the ball bouncing awkwardly, he did well to slice it past the oncoming keeper. 2-1.<br>
						Sala continued to turn the screw for the rest of the first half, despite a couple of hairy moments at the back. With Clarkey and Steve completely dominant in the air though, Jetro's attacks began to dry up.<br>
						At half time new boy Yusuke came on for Doug Lee and impressed everyone with his quick feet and cool head. Sala pushed forward relentlessly in search of an equaliser from the start.<br>
						It arrived after about ten minutes, when following a melee in the box, the ball broke (was passed by Toby?) kindly to Charles who put it into the roof of the net. 2-2<br>
						Minutes later Steve thought that he had given Sala the lead, but his header from a corner was ruled offside. With no more imperious a witness than TML's own Sid Lloyd, there was little complaint. Sala didnt have to wait long though, Giles and Lenny found more and more room out wide as ther game went on, and Yusuke began overlapping well up the right. After one such attack was broken up, Charles swung the ball back into the box where Dhugal was waiting. The header was perfect, back across the keeper into the far corner of the net.<br>
						It was a tense finish as Sala tried to hold on to their lead, and Jetro scrambled desperately for a point. The final nail in the coffin arrived right at the death. Lenny flicked on a long clearance and Toby once again scampered free. This time he found himself pushed out towards the left hand corner of the penalty box on his weaker left foot. With the seconds ticking though, he elected to shoot, and unleashed a piledriver over the keepers head into the top right corner. Game over. Sala 4v2 Jetro. All credit to Jetro, who played a clean game, and almost stole a draw at the end.<br>
