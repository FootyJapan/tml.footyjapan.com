				<P><b>OiFuto, 26th Sept, 2004.</b> B.F.C. failed to hold on to a 1-0 lead against a stubborn B.E.F.C. on Sunday evening. B.F.C. started brightly hoping to maintain their unbeaten record and scored the first after 10 minutes and some 
				neat build up play from defense, resulting in a clinical 40 yard pass finding young Tomo at full pace and through on goal. <BR>
				B.E.F.C. were chasing the game until midway through the first half when their long-ball game finally unsettled the B.F.C. back line and started to pay dividends. 5 minutes before the half-time whistle and the B.F.C. defense gave away 
				a corner that was skillfully curved in by Simon Woolhouse. The ball found it's way through a crowd of Jumping players &amp; straight into the net to the delight of 'Wooly', 1-1.<BR>
				The second half saw an energized B.E.F.C. surge forward as Simon Collier and Big Vern consistently cleared their lines from the back. A lack of vision and accuracy with the final ball ensured that the B.E.F.C. keeper was kept 
				unchallenged in the early second half stage. However B.F.C. desperate to secure a win created a few half-chances in the dying minutes, only to be foiled by tenacious defending and mediocre finishing.<BR>

				<b class=blue>HIBS STILL GOING.</b><BR>
				An excellent start by the Hibs resulted in an early goal by Keita Narama after a great through ball from Taras Koochin. Geckoes settled and threatened briefly through Kazu Kikichi. However, Hibs continued to dominate and a great run 
				by Dave Thomas was followed by a fine save by Rob Keyworth. The Geckoes keeper was again called into action making a great save from Bevan Colless' powerful header from a corner. However, there was nothing he could do to stop Bevan's 
				next header, again from a corner - 2-0.<BR>
				The second half was a more even contest with Geckoes putting some good passing moves together. However, they rarely tested Hibs keeper Hitoshi Ono. Midway through the second half, Bevan Colless was put through to beat the offside 
				trap. He unselfishly squared the ball to Kuni Katase who only had to hit the ball into an empty net. The final result was 3-0 to Hibs.<BR>

				</table><P><b>OiFuto, 25th Sept, 2004.</b> Sala FC sorely missed their inspirational Naoki Ogasawara, while France FC welcomed back Gilles Soulie as the 2 teams met on Saturday. And it was Soulie who made his mark after just 12 minutes 
				when he got onto the end of a cross swung in from the right wing. Despite having not played for a few months, he made no mistake in putting it in the back of the net. Olly Worsfold added a 2nd at the half-hour mark with a lovely turn and 
				volley from the edge of the 6 yard box.<BR>
				Sala fought back hard and 5 minutes later a well weighted through ball put Kentaro Ishii clean through with the keeper caught in nomans-land. Ishii deft chip left the keeper with nothing to do but watch, as it sailed in for 2-1.<BR>
				In the 2nd half, Sala made a few changes in formation, but nothing seemed to work. They seemed to run out of ideas every time they got near the goal. The French were quite content to just wait &amp; attack on the counter. On 73 minutes 
				the French floated in a free kick from out on the right. A combination of the 2 Yannicks made sure the ball was fist flicked on then stabbed in at the back post. A great 3-1 victory for France and some work to do for Sala.<BR>
				<b class=red>SWISS SWAMP JETRO TO GO TOP.</b><BR>
				Swiss went about carving up Jetro FC with surgical precision, taking a 3-0 lead in the first half and ending with a 5-0 victory. A penalty by captain Kirk was added to by James Batten, Karl Hanhe and 2 for Koichi Uchida. That puts 
				them at the top of the table but they will meet their partners at the top, Hibs, next week at OiFuto. This was Jetro's 1st game of the season as they are still completing their matches in the Tokyo League.<BR>

				<b class=blue>VAGABONDS HOLD OFF CELTS.</b><BR>
				Vagabonds turned in a strong second half display to earn maximum points and move into 2nd spot in the TML 2nd Division table. The Celts went ahead when Colman Murray crashed in a shot from the edge of the penalty area, after a neat 
				one two. Mike Yeomans levelled  with a Beckham-esque free kick on the edge of the penalty area and Lyndsey Hughes blasted Vags ahead on 70 minutes after some sterling work on the right side of the field. <BR>
				Lyndsey Hughes extended the Vags lead to 3-1 on 76 minutes, after a mix up in the  Celts defence. Then Keiran McGowan bundled the ball home with ten minutes remaining for a frantic finish. <BR>
				The day was marred by Vags man-of-the-match Joe Cherian's horrific head injury after a collision while challenging for a header. He received a nasty gash in his forehead that required hospital treatment and stitches.<BR>
				<b>MY</b><BR>
				<b class=red>JETS GET OFF THE MARK.</b><BR>
				Saitama Jets picked up their first points of the season with a victory over Barbarians at Ina on Saturday. The Jets managed to control most of the match but only found the net once in the first half when Ryan Loren controlled a loose 
				ball on the edge of the box and span to volley home. <BR>
				The second half was played almost exclusively in Barbarians  territory but the Jets couldn't manage to score a second goal with Nathan Gildart and captain Mark Eite both missing chances. The Barbarians managed several breaks and 
				could have embarassed the home team but didn't really consistently threaten<BR>

				</table><P><b>OiFuto, 20th Sept, 2004.</b> A single goal early in the 2nd half was enough for Kanto Celts to take all the points against Wallstreet Clash.<BR>
				Both teams were well up for the match, fighting hard in mid-field but with neither team taking full control. Celts came close in the 1st half when Eric Persson was blocked at close range while at the other end Celts new Frenchman 
				Valentine turned hero when he cleared a shot from his own line then turned striker in the 2nd half scoring the winner. Neither team had too many chances thanks to some good solid defending and the standard of footy was looking very good, 
				promising more good games in Div 2.<BR>

				<b class=blue>Barbarians and Vags Share Points.</b><BR>
				In blustery conditions at Oi 2 on Sunday night the Barbarians and Vagabonds battled it out and came away with a point each after a 1-1 draw. The first half saw few clear chances but the Barbarians came closest with a headed effort 
				from a corner that narrowly cleared the crossbar. The Barbarians, with the wind at their backs, dominated possession in the second half and took the lead early on when a 'shot-come-cross' from a free kick by Alex Durning eluded 
				everyone and managed to sneak inside the far post. The Barbarians looked the more likely team to score, but in the end created few clear-cut chances and were limited to a number of near misses from long-range free kicks. <BR>
				With ten minutes to go a long ball down field by the Vagabonds was met by young Alex Sahara who cut inside the full back and shot straight at the keeper. Luckily for the Vags, the keeper seemed to lose track of the ball in flight 
				and it sneaked through his grasp and into the net. A fair(ish) result, but both teams will need to improve if they are to challenge the front runners in this league.<BR>

				<b class=red>LATE DUTCH PENALTY SINKS AFC.</b><BR>
				When So Takada went down in the box late into the match, AFC Wanderers thought the ref was penalizing him for diving. When he got a penalty, he didn't argue, he just buried it in the top left-hand corner giving the Finnish Keeper no 
				chance.<BR>
				Up till that point, AFC had done well to keep out last years 3rd placed Dutch Embassy team, having expected some thrashings as in the FJ Cup. With Andy Watanabe ruling with a iron rod, they've progressed a long way over the Summer, 
				picking up a few new signings. Dutch were ever dangerous, with An-li Tan &amp; So Takada being the biggest threat. Takada should have scored early in the 2nd half, when a cross ball found him in front of an open goal but he sliced wide 
				to the dismay of his team-mates. <BR>
				AFC thought they'd done enough to earn a point and were gutted by the penalty. Things turned a little bit ugly in the last minute, with a couple of the players shaping up for 'Handbags at 10 paces'. The ref was having none of it 
				and sent the pair off for an early shower. Lets hope a match ban will help them keep their handbags at home next time!<BR>

				Mid-way through the 1st half Swiss went ahead after a good bit of dribbling skill by David Pratt was completed with a pinpoint cross to striker Ian Brown-Peterside. He made no mistake in his finishing for 1-0 or again 5 minutes later as 
				he got his 2nd after dribbling his way through the Maritizio defence. Takahisa Suzuki added a third before the break, sliding home the loose ball after Maritizio's keeper had made a brave stop to deny Angelo of the Swiss.<BR>
				After the break, Maritizio started to play better as a team, linking up well to give Swiss something to worry about but they were always stymied in the last third. Vernon Gill, Maritizio's captain, was at a loss with what to do but realized more 
				training is required for his new recruits to come together. Only one more goal was conceded though, as Karl Hanhe found the back of the net again for Swiss, with the final result being 4-0 leaving Swiss up with BFC at the top of the table.<BR><BR>
				<b class=red>TML SEES FIRST FEMALE PLAYER IN YOKOTA V JETS MATCH</b><BR>
				In a victory for democracy, women players were seen in Division 2 with the blessing of all the managers. Both JETs and Yokota united had been banned from using women in other leagues but after consultation with managers of Div 2 teams, 
				TML gave the thumbs up. Yokota have a couple of very talented young ladies who play for the US Airforce team and don't mind getting stuck in and they fielded one against JETs on Saturday.<BR>
				In a very even battle, the result came down to an unfortunate own goal from a sliced attempted clearance from a JETs defender. Yokota were happy to get the 3 points while the JETs were happy to see more equality after their mistreatment 
				when they had a female player.<BR>

				The first match of Div 2, between Shane FC &amp; newcomers Kwansei Gakuin FC got off to a delayed kick-off, when due to a last minute emegency Shane's kit never managed to make it to the venue. So it was a rather bedraggled looking Shane FC, who went out to face 
				KGFC in their Real Madrid strip. The 1st half was an even battle however, with both teams playing well and coming close but it was still deadlocked at half time.<BR>
				Shane were also missing their inspirational centre-half Dave Callaghan and their goalkeeper, so this led to a procession of keepers going in for short periods and numerous moves of position. KGFC 
				took advantage of the constant changes, settling down themselves and working well through mid-field.<BR>
				They finally got the break they were looking for, when Tsuyoshi Fujita unleashed a shot from the edge of the box that left the keeper clawing the air. Fujita followed it soon after with a 2nd, and when an unlucky Shane defender deflected 
				a third into his own net, it was game over. A great start for the new lads of KGFC!<BR><BR>

					<p>Sala looked to be on for their biggest ever league victory when they went in to half-time with a 5-0 lead against newly promoted British Embassy FC (ex- Perfidious Albion). They had scored after just 5 minutes, when a free kick curled over the wall by Stephen Brooke-Smith, slipped straight through the gloves of keeper Giles Lever. Usually it should have been a comfortable save but with monsoon like rain and wind, what should have been simple turned into disaster. A 2nd cross/shot only minutes later also ended up in the back of the net as again it squirmed out of the hapless keepers grasp.<br>
						Things turned from bad to worse as Sala were awarded a penalty that was duly disposed of by captain Paul Clarke. Brian Gallagher added a 4th with another well struck free kick and Brookey got his 2nd with a 25 yard drive. At 5-0 down, BEFC were happy to hear the whistle go for the break, wondering what had gone so terribly wrong.<br>

					<p>Who could have predicted how the 2nd half would pan out though. BEFC pulled a goal back within 5 minutes, only to see it cancelled out by Sala shortly after. They then saw a 2nd goal being cancelled out within minutes of getting it, the score rising to 7-2. Sala's back line seemed to have all come unglued, with BEFC becoming the more dominant of the 2 teams. The last 10 minutes were frantic as Sala watched the score suddenly grow closer as Simon Woolhouse got his 2nd goal and Silvano &amp; Fernando both scored for BEFC to bring the tally to 7-5. It was Sala's turn to wonder what was happening but luckily for them, they were saved by the final whistle. It was great to see neither teams spirits were dampened by the awful weather and they supplied a thoroughly entertaining game of football.<br>
						<br>
						<b class=red>BFC DO HIGH FIVE OVER MARITIZIO</b><br>
						BFC started the new season brightly, with a comfortable 5-1 win over the new look Maritizio at OiFuto DaiNi ground on Sunday evening. Maritizio have taken aboard many new players during the summer, including a number from the late Nelson FC, and were out early for warm-up drills. BFC were missing a couple of regulars but looked very composed from the start, moving the ball around well. They got a break after just 10 minutes, when captain Brian Doyle sent a perfect 40 yard diagonal ball through for Tomomitsu Kunii to latch on to the end of and slip home for 1-0.<br>
						Maritizio fought back though and a good run down the left saw a shot only half cleared by the keeper, right to the feet of striker Yoshizaka who made no mistake in putting his shot away for 1-1. This kicked BFC back into action and they started to take control for long periods. Their 2nd goal came from a free kick near the left touchline. The ball was floated into the box to be flicked on by the head of Mark Roughly and nestle into the top right corner, 2-1, which is the way it remained till half-time.<br>
						BFC had a scare at the start of the 2nd half when a mix-up saw the keeper caught in no-mansland and an ensuing lob bounce up and hit the bar. They then gradually took control once again though and goals by Neil Collins, Jon Day &amp; Evans sealed the fate of Maritizio and left BFC at the top of Div 1 after the 1st weekend.<br>
						<br>
						<b class=blue>SO, YOU SCORE AGAIN!</b><br>
						Last years Div 2 top scorer So Takada was the first on the scoreboard as Dutch Embassy Team met the new Wallstreet Clash FC in the final game of the evening at Oi. With 7 goals to his name last season, Takada got DET off the mark with a dipping volley after just 12 minutes. Clash fought back hard and the streaking Chris Waters wasn't too happy to be pulled back when almost through on goal and the offender not be carded. Nothing came from the free kick and as hard as they tried, Clash couldn't crack the Dutch defence.<br>
						It was while Clash were committing men forward that the Dutch caught them on the counter attack. A through ball was met by captain Anli Tan and he made no mistake in his finishing for 2-0. After the break, Anli scored another to make it 3-0 but still the Clash wouldn't lie down. With 10 minutes remaining, Phil Stroud pulled one back for the clash with a nice turn and shot into the top corner but it was too little, too late. The final scoreline, 3-1.<br>

				Keita Narama has now scored the 1st goal in both seasons of TML,  sliding one home against France FC late in the first half of their opening day match. After starting strongly, Hibs were unable to find an opener, 
				letting France get more settled. With both teams sporting a host of new summer signings, it appeared there was a lack of cohesion at times in the squads, with moves breaking down and lack of communication.<BR>
				As the half wore on though, Hibs started to find their form again, great work by the Hibs mid-field led to the ball being slipped through to young Keita, who was left with an easy side foot into the net. <BR>
				With just 2 minutes to the break, 
				this came as a blow to the French but they battled on till the half-time whistle with their new goalie pulling off a fine save to prevent further score.<BR><BR>
				The French took things to the Hibs in the 2nd period, trying a cheeky shot from the center spot directly from kick-off. Their pressure on Hibs was rewarded after just 5 minutes, when usually solid Hitoshi Ono in the Hibs goal, seemed to 
				mishandle the ball under pressure, allowing Etsushi Yoshikoshi in to score the equalizer. <BR><BR>

						France wouldn't lie down though and with just 3 minutes to go, Ollie Worsfold worked his magic down the left and put in a cross that was perfectly met on the volley by Yannick Pelerin. 3-2. The French couldn't get another before the time ran out though, so Hibs go straight back to where they came from, the top of the table......for now!<br>
