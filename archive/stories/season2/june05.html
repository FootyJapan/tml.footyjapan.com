				<td><h1 class=red>EMBASSY GO DOWN FIGHTING!</h1>
				<p><b>Sat 25th June, St Mary's.</b> A sunny Saturday afternoon at St. Mary's was the venue for the end of season clash between two sides with nothing to play for except their pride. With BEFC having already been relegated to 
				Division Two some weeks ago, you would have thought that this would have been a dour game, wrong!   Goals, goals and more goals was the order of the day as these two sides produced an eight goal thriller.<BR>

					<p>BEFC minus several keys players started sluggishly and were punished inside the opening 15 minutes as a Jetro midfielder picked a loose ball up from just inside the Embassy half and surged forward on a darting run which ended with a clinical right foot finish into the top right corner of the BEFC goal.<br>
						More Embassy sloppy defending on a corner around the 30 minute mark led to goal number two with JETRO heading home from close range beyond the desperate lunge of Mohamed, who could do little but groan as the ball crossed the line. BEFC suddenly sparked into life and the midfield combination of Kotaro, Mike Yeomans, Masa and Gerrard were creating chances at last.&nbsp; BEFC New boy pounced on a loose ball from the centre of the park, wriggled past a few half hearted challenges and slotted the ball home to make it 1-2. &nbsp;Half time couldn't come quickly enough for Jetro as their game plan seemed to be flying out the window, as error after error broke up their pattern of play in the final minutes of the first half.<br>

					<p>The interval gave the respite that Jetro needed, as they went 3-1 up within the opening minute of resumed play.&nbsp; Straight from the kick off Jetro played the ball out to their outside right who centred for an unmarked striker to gleefully head home. 3-2.<br>
						BEFC then pulled one back, Masa crossing beautifully from the right and new boy heading home powerfully from the centre of the six yard box for his second of the match.&nbsp; The pattern of play now was becoming more open with defensive errors a plenty.&nbsp; It was a comedy of errors which led to Jetros fourth goal.&nbsp; Centre back Sendo and BEFC keeper Mohamed failed to clear a loose ball which allowed JETRO to walk the ball into an empty goal, oh dear! &nbsp;4-2.<br>
						Minutes later the game took another twist as a BEFC forward dribbled and danced Brazilian style through the Jetro defence to slide the ball under the keeper 4-3.&nbsp; The fight back though was short lived and more clumsy defending allowed Jetro to finish off another stylish move and put the game beyond BEFC.<br>
						BEFC play their football next season in Division 2 and will be hoping to galvanize their troops for the coming campaign ahead, especially after such a tough season. &nbsp;Jetro will be looking to shore up their defence, if they wish to avoid a possible relegation battle next season.<br>

						<br>
						The game kicked-off with YCAC only managing to field a squad of 12, whereas the Swiss had at least two subs to give the team some options and respite for players when needed.<br>
						<br>
						The first turning point in the game came when the Swiss left back, Kai, carried the ball from 40yds out, attacking the space in front of him aggressively, YCAC failed to close the space and the young defender had all the time in the world to wind up, hit a rocket and force a very good save from Derek, the young YCAC keeper.<br>
						<br>
						Seconds later and it was Krando for the Swiss who carried the ball into the YCAC box, but instead of squaring the ball to an open Angelo, he rifled one off the upright, much to the relief of the YCAC back four, who had been caught napping. <a href="javascript:popwindow('http://www.Metropolis-League.com/archive/stories/05reps/0618fjfinal.html','top=150,left=50,width=550,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">More...</a><br>

						<b class=red>Ten-man Sala battle past BFC to finish third.</b><br>
						<b>Sat 18th June, OiFuto</b> Ten-man Sala FC made light of their numerical disadvantage to beat BFC 1-0 on Saturday, securing third place in the TML. Xavier Hernandez tucked in a left-foot shot from the edge of the box midway through the second half to give Sala the points after having Yoshiki Endo sent off for violent conduct. BFC's hopes of finishing third were raised when Endo was sent off for senselessly lashing out at a BFC player as tempers flared following a dangerous tackle by the same player.<br>
						However, Sala responded well and Hernandez took advantage of some sloppy defending to beat the BFC goalkeeper with a low shot in the 70th minute.<br>
						Midfielder Tomo Kunii had a shot cleared off the line as BFC pushed for an equaliser and Brian Doyle blazed over late on but Sala held on to take the points.<br>

					<p>This was never going to be a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Two big teams with a lot of Brits on the park. The first half saw few chances at either end, though Toby will probably feel that he could have gone closer when the ball broke to him at the back post after a salmonesque leap by Giles.<br>
						BFC had a great chance to go ahead, when Sala didn't play the whistle after a handball shout, but their striker was a little eager to shoot and his effort from the edge of the box flew narrowly wide.<br>
						Xavier was the star of the show in the first half though, his running with the ball and without it were equally impressive and he continues to defy gravity by outjumping&nbsp;&nbsp;players a foot taller than him. But Yoshiki and Yusuke also had cool heads at the back and got forward well. In general Sala had the better of the first half but not by much, and BFC still looked like getting on the score sheet.<br>
						The second half didnt really get going until Yoshiki's sending off. This seemed to cement Sala's resolve, and they got stuck in harder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guido, Steve and Clarkey seemed to win almost every ball flung at them for a while.<br>
						Charles, attempting a bicycle kick was kneed in the head by Sid &quot;Remy Bonjasky&quot; Lloyd, and had to go off. The return of Brian to the fray saw a renewed ambition upfront for Sala, and this eventually culminated in the goal.<br>
						Toby did well on the right, as he had for most of the half, and fed Xavier on the edge of the box who placed a low left footed shot in off the near post. 1v0.<br>
						After the goal, Guido took off Brian and put on Naoki to shore up the backline. He got straight into the mix and capped a great 15 minute cameo with one of the best tackles all season, not giving an inch against a much bigger, heavier opponent. Brookey came on for Lenny and fired up the midfield once more, as the final stages approached<br>
						The last five saw some high drama, BFC's Tomo had a shot cleared off the line and another striker blazed a drive over from only 8 yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
						The commitment and running showed by every Sala player in those final 5 (and then some!) minutes was a great ending to a pretty poor season.<br>
						Still, we finished third, and that aint so bad.<br>
						Finally thanks again to Martin and Naoki who didnt get much of an outing, none at all in Martins case. Its happened to me before and it isnt much fun, but this is how a football team works and the chance to play comes around again soon enough.<br>

With Striker/Captain Neil Willis having left for the UK, Shane seemed a bit lost in front of goal, putting a few 1 on 1's wide of the mark. Yokota, as usual, were very fit, but lacked any real menace with the Shane boys having the lions share of possesion but it was the boys from Yokota air base who got off the mark first with one of their only attacks of the match. Tim Fearney latched onto a through ball and smashed home a fierce volley from 30 yards out. It looked like they would take all the points securing the 2nd promotion spot in division 2, but a last minute penalty gave Shane FC the equalizer meaning if Nova FC can win their last match by more than 2 goals, they will replace Yokota as the 2nd promoted team!<br>

					<p><b class=red>YCAC, FRANCE PLAY OUT DRAW</b><br>
						YCAC got the point it needed to cement 5th place in Div 1 with a 2-2 draw against France FC at St Marys on Sunday. They did it the hard way, spotting the opposition a 2 goal lead after 2 early defensive lapses. Goals either side of HT from new boy Mike Foster and Gavin Margetson squared things up, however, and despite further chances at both ends, that's the way it finished<br>
						A point apiece was no less than both teams deserved having serving up a spirited and skilful encounter belying its end of season/mid table status.<br>
						<b>STaw</b><br>
						<b class=blue>YCAC &amp; FFC sp(l)it the points at St Mary's</b><br>
						The French raced into a 2-0 lead after only 20mins goals following Olly Worsfold's close range effort and Takahiko Kanno's powerblaster from the edge of the box. However after a disputed French third was disallowed the YCAC roared back into the game and after hitting the post twice, YCAC fully deserved to equalise with goals either side of the halftime break. Whilst the game was played at a breakneck speed, there were also some moments of genuine quality.<br>
						The final scoreline of 2-2 was fair enough given that either team could of nicked the winner but then that would have been harsh on the opponent. Disappointingly, the great spirit of the game was nearly ruined in the final moments when players from either team accused one another of spitting. This is something that I personally DO NOT want to see and its up to the team captains and the league to stamp this out. Final word for the great referee who allowed football to be played but was also not afraid to tell the players to shutup if that was required without any bias or histrionics. Nice work fella!.<br>

					<p><b>Sat 4th June,</b> Great day for a game, a little bit unfortunate that it had to be at St. Mary's which is small for some big bruisers on both sides, but who can complain when I can't find any grounds myself!<br>
						The game started on time in spite of the Swiss' arrival 10 minutes before kick-off due to traffic.&nbsp; Both teams at full strength although it seemed like the Hibs were missing a few regulars. &nbsp;The pace was set early with some nice passing of the ball and the Hibs. sending some early balls into the box from the right.&nbsp; The Swiss try and take Bevan and Keita out of these matches and Spiers and Trevor were up to the task early on.&nbsp; Going the other way, Aoki on the right and James on the left were sending in some nice crosses which Karl and Suzuki were not getting to and Hitoshi was showing his strength. &nbsp;As the game progressed, more possession in midfield, especially for the Swiss, led to some good chances although shots were being stopped by Ike, Terry, and Hitoshi. &nbsp;A &nbsp;few corners were won and Krando sent one across the face of the goal, far enough away from Hitoshi, which Dave Pratt volleyed home beautifully after about 15 minutes.&nbsp; The Swiss seemed to gain confidence with that and more passing through midfield led to some nice balls into the box but no one was really looking like finishing them.&nbsp; One danger moment for the Swiss was a weak back pass from JP which was intercepted by Keita, he quickly found the center forward for a 1-1 vs. Peter but he mis-hit the shot wide.<br>
						After about 30 minutes, some good work in midfield led to Dave Pratt being free about 20-25 meters out, he decided to wind up the canon and let it fly. &nbsp;A beautiful shot across the goal from the right into the side netting on the left.&nbsp; Even Dave Pratt was able to smile at the skill on that one, beating Hitoshi in goal from distance is tough to do but this shot was unstoppable. &nbsp;The first half ended 2-0 to the Swiss with things looking pretty comfortable.<br>
						<br>
						The Swiss made a more changes at half time as a group of 14 players requires it. &nbsp;In spite of the changes, about 10 minutes in to the 2H, Aoki sent in a perfectly weighted cross to Kai who back headed across the goal (away from Hitoshi) for Karl to knock home with another header. &nbsp;It was good team skill and a great finish by the joint top scorer in the league.&nbsp; 3-0 to the Swiss with 30 minutes left meant that more player changes were made.<br>
						One change was made on the Hibs side as their center forward went down with a dislocated shoulder.&nbsp; Mick was brought on but a mere 5 minutes after being on the pitch, he was fouled by Krando (which Ricky correctly called). then for some reason, he lost it completely and proceeded to attack krando stunning everyone. Everyone including the ref, was watching and there was no choice but to send him off. &nbsp;Haven't seen that one since high school in Texas, pretty amazing but it will leave the organizers with the task of finding a just punishment for such a reprehensible offence.<br>
						The game got sloppier after that but the Hibs. kept pressing even with one man down.&nbsp; Their hard work was rewarded when Keita Narama tapped in from close range to make it 3-1.&nbsp; The Swiss defense held up after that to close out a deserved 3-1 win that takes them to the final of the Cup for at least a shot at defending the title and winning the double.<br>

					<p>YCAC scraped through the &quot;other&quot; semi final 2-1 on Saturday at St Marys. The game ended in the gloom of an impending storm with YCAC resorting to some pretty dour defending to cling on to the 2-1 lead that it had held at HT.<br>
						It wasn't all like that though. YCAC started very brightly and played some of its best football of the season for the 1st 30 minutes. Will Richards on the left and Daisuke Ogawa on the right were able to put in numerous dangerous crosses across the face of the Jets goal. Most flashed across invitingly enough but with no takers. Then Joe Takeda, from Wills cross, and Daisuke, from Joes, were able to finish from close range to give the Div 1 team a 2 goal cushion against its Div 2 opponents.<br>
						Right on HT though, Gary Garner was given the freedom of the YCAC penalty area and his neat finish put a different perspective on things. The Jets confidence grew throughout the 2H and YCAC were unable to put out the fire with a 3rd goal despite continuing to create the better chances. A James Absolom header and a Joe Takeda shot both hit the inside of the Jets post and bounced across the goal. Joe had a goal disallowed and also hit the bar from a corner.<br>
						Despite all their pressure the Jets were unable to create any further clearcut chances and YCAC hung on, just about deservedly, to earn another crack at the Swiss<br>

						<b class=red>SALA SEND BEFC BACK TO DIV 2</b><br>
						The last time so many white shirts were seen together, somebody was in fear of a lynching. An unprecedented turn out of more than 11 players for the first time in living memory, helped Sala to keep the race for third going right down to the wire. The first match this season between these two teams yielded 12 goals in an incredible 7-5 thriller.&nbsp;This one could have gone the same way. But for two missed penalties by BEFC, the scoreline could have read very differently.<br>
						Sala started brightly and took an early lead when the artist formerly known as Big Gay Steve, popped up at a corner for one of his trademark towering headers. 1v0.<br>
						BEFC took it in their stride though and pressed forward.&nbsp;Steve, in an act of misguided charity decided to make amends for his goal by hauling down a BEFC striker in the box. From the resulting penalty however, Serbian basketball legend Ivan pulled out a great save. Sala went straight up the other end and rubbed salt and vinegar in the wound by going two nil up.<br>
						Dhugal latched onto a through ball and made rounding the keeper look very easy, again. 2v0.<br>
						More drama than saturday night in a English market town was to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet inswinging corner by BEFC was destined for the back of the net until Lenny's hand got in the way. Another penalty and a lucky booking for Lenny whom the referee felt had not moved his hand to the ball in an effort to stop it. Ivan must have intimidated the taker with his fearsome size, and the spot kick went narrowly over. Once again lady luck shone on Sala, who went up the pitch and scored again.<br>
						Brian's long throws caused trouble all day long, and from one such missile, Charles hooked a volley into the top right corner. 3v0 and BEFC must have been gutted at half-time.<br>
						The second half wasn't quite as&nbsp;&nbsp;good value, especially after the fourth goal went in. Toby latched on to a Shigeru through ball, before beating his man and slotting home from 10 yards, 4v0. Brian forced the keeper into a couple of good saves late on, whilst at the other end&nbsp;the Sala defence kept the door shut, the memory of last weeks French lesson still etched clearly on their faces.<br>
						The last goal came from Charles' corner, which Clarkey volleyed home from the penalty spot. 5v0. The last game of the season between Sala and BFC will be for third place, winner takes all(Well, all that third place has to offer.<br>
