					<p><b>Sat 23rd April,</b> Great day for a game of footy, too bad it was hard a very tough one for the Swiss vs. the British Embassy. Starting with an offensive formation, the Swiss appeared to think chances in abundance were going to lead to goals. Unfortunately, as was the case the week earlier against Maritizio in the first half, an inability to find the net by what has been a potent strike force nearly cost them precious points. The game started with the Swiss holding position and BEFC working hard (especially with only 10 men at the start) to pressure and then get all their men behind the ball. It paid off for the first 15 minutes until the Swiss were able to get a cross in to speedy Yuji who snuck in to tap in from close range. The rest of the first half, it was more of the same. Swiss holding on to the ball and trying to find a way in but too many passes or too many crosses to no one aggressive enough in the area meant many chances were wasted. Everyone was guilty of either not having a crack on target or getting on the end of a corner or a cross. Credit to the BEFC defense who worked hard and pressured the forwards and cleared numerous chances away but it was really the lack of Swiss ability to put it away which proved to be the weak spot. The first half ended 1-0 to the Swiss but it should have been more, the BEFC had barely been in the Swiss half of the field and didn't have a shot all half.<br>
						The second half looked to be more of the same possession-wise and the Swiss hoped the introduction of Angelo might spark the attack force. Instead, more missed chances and a lack of understanding between new players caused more confusion than opportunity. It was very frustrating to watch from the back and it is games like these that lead to upsets. That looked to be on the cards when 20 minutes into the 2H, the BEFC earned a free kick near midfield. Their big central defender came up into attack to act as the target man. He pushed Kirk off the header (another no-call from King Kazu) and the ball bounced near the top of the box without anyone claiming it. New defensive recruit Cho had a free chance to clear it but instead passed it directly to the on-rushing big man who then shot calmly into the lower left hand corner of the net for a 1-1 tie. Completely against the run of play but a well taken goal off a defensive error.&Ecirc;<br>
						For the Swiss, with title aspirations on the line, everything was thrown forward to try and score the winner. No more passing around, crosses from everywhere into the box. At least people started shooting more and started to test the keeper. Angleo's acrobatics were on display as he tried a bicycle kick in the area to no avail. Suzuki shooting from distance drew a nice save from the keeper, later on he shot from 7 yards out, straight to the corner flag. Kai had a beautiful header off a corner kick going into the right hand corner only for Angelo to block it away. The Swiss tried everything with no result. The game seemed destined for a draw as a result of the well organized BEFC defense and the woeful Swiss attack. Luckily, with about 5 minutes to go, a cross from the right bounced in behind the defense and Angelo's hard work paid off again with a difficult but well taken goal. The cheers from the Swiss team had never been louder and everyone breathed a sigh of relief at what appeared to be the game winner &lt;ETH&gt; the last 5 minutes seemed long but the final whistle was a welcome one. A very ugly victory but in league play, anything can happen on any day. Well done to the BEFC for sticking to a strategy that nearly paid off. The Swiss have got to be more clinical in front of the net in their last 2 matches to have any hope of claiming the title.<br>

KGFC, with one game yet to play against AFC Wanderers, are over 10 points clear of second place Yokota, who were beaten by the champions 3-2 at Ina, Saitama on April 16. KGFC, a team comprised of Kwansei Gakuin University (not so) old boys, have only conceded 6 goals in the entire season so far and have scored a whopping 39. They have quite literally been untouchable in the second division and are looking forward to playing some more competitive football in the new season starting in September. TML rules state that all new teams joining the league must first play in the lower division. Even the big-guns in the first division will have their work cut out for them with this young, fit and technically superlative team.<br>

						<b class=blue>HIBS COME FROM BEHIND TO DUMP SALA FROM CUP.</b><br>
						Injuries and travel reduced the Hibs to an under-strength line up for this important fixture with Mick O'hagan stepping into Hitoshi's sizeable shoes in goal. Sala were also weakened by the recent losses of Naoki, Jody and Stephen Brooke-Smith. Sala however lacked nothing in physical size and presence and are always well up for a game against the Hibs. The opening exchanges were physical with many challenges from both sides ending in fouls. Midway through the first half and Terry was harshly judged to have fouled a Sala defender while winning a header about 40 yards out. The kick was swung in and Dhugal Beddingfield directed a soft header goal wards from 8 yards out. The ball bounced once (maybe twice?) and it would have been a regulation save for Hitoshi. Unfortunately for the Hibs it was O'hagan not Ono in the number 1 Hibs shirt and the ball somehow found its way over the gloves and into the Hibs net. It was to be Sala's only shot on target all game. The scores remained 1-0 at half time.<br>
						15 minutes into the second half and the Hibs Yasu Yomota received the ball in traffic wide on the left. He decided to try his luck and run at the flock of defenders and somehow got through 4 or 5 to find himself in space at the byline and he cut the ball back diagonally across the box. With all the Sala defenders charging towards Yasu the top of the box was left unguarded and the ball reached Bevan who struck the ball low and back into the far corner; wrong-footing the keeper and putting the Hibs level. Keita soon produced some magic after a post corner scrap and he poked the ball inside the keeper's near post to put the Hibs ahead 2-1. Sala's collective frustration boiled over with their defender Clarkey, who had been having a very good game; fouling Tetsu from behind. Clarkey was furious for what he saw as diving and felt that warranted him one free swing of his boot at the prone Hibs man. Fortunately Quentin didn't agree that he was entitled to this and promptly showed him a red card.<br>
						The last 15 minutes of the game saw Sala concentrate on playing football again; but they let several set pieces go to waste before time ran out on them and the score finsihed at 2-1. Sala do not have to wait long for their chance at revenge as the two teams meet in the league game next Sunday. The Hibs move on to play the Swiss in the semi finals; who will hope to have their famed watches finally adjusted correctly to get them to the match on time. <b>Bevan Colless</b><br>

						<b class=red>SWISS BLUSHES SAVED AFTER FOCUSED 2nd HALF.</b><br>
						Another great spring day for a game, the Swiss nearly managed to miss it by getting off at the wrong exit and then getting stuck in the great Saitama jam. Fortunately, the bus pulled up just as we approached the time deadline set by Quentin and the Ina Sports center and we were able to start the game (as opposed to the last game of last year's league). The quarterfinals of the League Cup with the Hibernian just having beaten Sala, they actually looked rather peeved when we arrived as I think they were starting to like the idea of playing Maritizio in the semis. Maritizio had been waiting, fortunately with only 10 players because at the start, the Swiss team was mentally still in the car. The pass work coming out of the back was ok but once in the attacking 3rd, people didn't know what to do. Angelo &amp; Dave Spiers firing wide (a little close to the corner flag actually), Karl knocking a header and a shot over from close range, people looking to pass instead of shoot and then shooting when the pass was the better option. While the Swiss couldn't hit the side of Roppongi Hills (or the Saitama Sports Center for that matter), Maritizio was settling in and a nice counter attack off some silly defending led to a very well taken goal and a 1-0 lead with 25 minutes gone. Uchida was left watching as the drive from the top of the area went in the left side of the goal. Kirk started screaming again and the tension started to rise on a clearly frustrated Swiss side. It didn't change the result though and the first half ended 1-0 to Maritizio.<br>
						At halftime, all the Swiss players agreed to settle down and focus a little more on putting the ball in the back of the net as opposed to picking out the perfect pass or the perfect rice paddy. The message got through and Dierk started the ball rolling with a well taken goal about 5 minutes in to draw the teams level. 5 minutes later, a corner kick from Aoki found Kirk's outstretched leg (around the defender) for a volley to make it 2-1. Maritizio's players' heads started to drop and the Swiss started to gain more confidence. After that, Angelo found the net 3 times with one great left footed shot and two scramblers, while Aoki and Karl both scored. There were more chances missed but the score was indicative of the traffic throughout the game. Maritizio could have used an extra player and might have put the Swiss out of the Cup if they had taken advantage of the Swiss sloppiness in the first half. However, once the Swiss focused, a better performance resulted and the numerous chances generated produced the goals.<br>

						<b class=blue>BFC stop the rot with embassy win</b><br>
						Two goals from Evans and one from new boy Shun Sieg helped BFC to a comfortable 5-0 victory over a struggling British Embassy team on Saturday. Sieg's sweetly-struck opener after 10 minutes set the tone and Evans doubled BFC's lead when his attempted cross drifted inside the far post. Captain Brian Doyle made it 3-0, heading in a Neil Collins corner five minutes before halftime. Collins set up Jon Day for a fourth and Evans claimed his second of the match with a deflected goal late on. After two successive defeats, BFC played with more urgency and with Collins and Evans in the mood, could have scored 10 against a depleted embassy side.<br>

					<p><b>Sun April 10th 2005. OiFuto.</b> Hibs had much the better of the 1st half as YCAC struggled to adapt in its 1st ever TML game away from the grass of Yokohama. The problems YCAC had in keeping the ball on the surface were compounded by the aggressive running and hustle of the Hibs team. They had obviously decided to go for the jugular from the start and their attacking formation was rewarded with an early goal. A lofted ball over the top left Keita advancing all alone on Derrick Beans goal. He expertly lofted the bouncing ball over the keepers head and it was 1-0 before YCAC had even begun to settle. With the YCAC defence tending to err on the side of caution and sit deep to defend the ball over the top there was plenty of space for Bevan and Mick O'Hagen to drop off and pick up the ball. Clever interplay from these 2 caused problems for the rest of the half but didn't create any more real chances for Hibs to increase their lead. James Absolom, who doesn't know the expression &quot;lost cause&quot;, almost squared things up late in the half when he latched on to a loose ball after the Hibs Goalie had collided with a defender, but his goal bound shot hit a retreating defender.<br>
						The 2H was a more even affair with the Hibs unable to keep up quite the pace of the 1H. As the game went on YCAC began to push men forward but looked susceptible to the counter attack. Keita seemed to have killed things with 10 minutes to go off when a defensive slip allowed him to run in unhindered on the YCAC goal. He finished at the 2nd attempt to leave YCAC with the proverbial mountain to climb. They couldn't but did get half way up, at least. A thunderous Damian Hart free kick forced Hitoshi Ono in the Hibs goal into a great diving save but seemed to knock some self belief into YCAC and they swarmed forward in earnest. Things were made interesting when Damian got a 2nd free kick outside the Hibs box. As is so often the case the shot he hit perfectly didn't go in but the one he didn't, did. The ball pinged through a crowd of players to leave Hitoshi unsighted and the ball snuck into the far corner.<br>
						Too little too late though and the Hibs closed out a deserved 2-1 win out in the semi darkness where the luminous green shirts finally looked like a good purchase<br>

					<p>Swiss Kickers preserved their lead at the top of the TML first division with a flattering 4-1 win over BFC on Saturday. Three handball decisions went against BFC, two of them resulting in goals for the Swiss and the other a vehement penalty appeal that was waved away. Angelo put the Swiss in front after 20 minutes after appearing to handle before a defensive mix-up let in Karl Hanhe for a second moments later. BFC then had a legitimate penalty claim turned down by referee Pietro, who then gave another free kick to the Swiss for another handball, although the ball appeared to hit Leigh's hand rather than vice-versa.<br>
						Swiss's Captain Kirk scored from the resulting free kick with a 30-metre blast that was still accelerating as it hit the back of the net. BFC had their chances, with strikers Jon Day and Alastair Himmer guilty of misses that were to prove costly. Five minutes into the second half, Angelo lobbed BFC goalkeeper Sid Lloyd after another defensive error to kill the game off for the Swiss. Substitute Lindsay Hughes pulled one back when his cross drifted over Swiss goalkeeper Dierk and into the far post. Defender Ryo Yasunaga twice went close with headers and Day was unable to control a Tomo Kunii cross when in space but in truth BFC had left themselves with a mountain to climb after the first half.<br>
						<b>H Bushwacker</b><br>
						Sunday, April 10th, perfect day at Oifuto for a match between old rivals, the BFC and the Swiss. Both teams had nearly full lineups at the start although the Swiss keeper's snowboarding accident still keeps him on the sidelines and a reserve was called into action - Dierk. The BFC's strength's lies in midfield with tough tackling in the middle and the skill players through Tomo and Neil out on the wings. The Swiss tried to counter that with James on Tomo and Suzuki and Yuji combining to snuff out dribbling menace Neil. In defense, Kirk, Trevor and Kai were given the job of shutting down the passes to Jon and Big Al. The start of the game was pretty even with both teams trying to connect through midfield. The first clear chance fell to the Swiss, it came from a cross from James on the left which Suzuki met brilliantly with a header only for Sid to dive to his right for the stop.<br>
						The Swiss midfield gradually started to assert control with Dave Spiers and Pratt working hard to win the ball and the spreading the ball wide or to Angelo and Karl in the middle. After 20 minutes or so, the Swiss sent enough balls into the box eventually for Angelo to bang one in after it bounced around. Just a few minutes later, Karl pounced on another loose ball from a corner which bounced off Trevor's face, Karl put it in calmly and made it 2-0. About 5 minutes later, a handball about 25 yards out led to a free kick which Kirk surprisingly smacked into the far corner for a 3-0 lead.<br>
						10 minutes and 3 quick goals seemed to take a lot of out of the BFC (it does most teams). A few players were subbed and the rhythm changed a bit but the pace of the game remained the same with the Swiss holding more possession and getting close but not finishing anymore than the 3 already scored.<br>
						In the 2H, more player changes were made but the tempo remained the same. The Swiss seemed to be able to hold onto the ball in midfield while the BFC was having trouble getting the ball to its forwards and the Swiss defense was regaining possession quickly. This led to one breakaway for Angelo which he knocked over Sid for a 4-0 lead with 15 minutes gone in the 2H. After that, the Swiss passed it around nicely but the work effort dropped and the BFC started to press more. They started more counter attacks and the midfield started to carry the ball better into the attacking 3rd. This resulted in corner kicks and a few shots on target. The Swiss did give up a goal on a cross into the wind which spiraled over Dierk. In the end, the Swiss effort dropped off a bit but the defense held up. Andy coming in goal after arriving at Narita a few hours earlier helped out and Dierk even got a few minutes out of goal.<br>

					<p>The Celts took a deserved point from their FJ cup game with Sala at a Sunny and Hot Ina in Saitama on Saturday afternoon. With both teams scrambling to field a team in the days preceding, it was always likely to be an open game and so it proved.<br>
						Sala started the brighter, with some slick passing unlocking the Celts defence only to find keeper Aki in great form between the sticks. As the game wore on the Celts managed to get a foothold in the game through the hardwork of midfield quartet Seamus, Magoo, Stephen and Jeremiah with Striker Tom dropping deep to pick up possession. The best they managed to show was a couple of long range efforts, including one deflected effort that nearly embarrassed the Sala keeper.<br>
						Sala ended the half on top, with Guido and Brian pulling the strings in the middle, they created a couple of chances before half time, one goal disallowed correctly for offside and one denied by a brilliant save by Aki.<br>
						The Celts began the second half with brighter, more enterprising play and took the lead after 8 minutes. Sala failed to clear a magoo cross properly and Ruairi rasped a screamer into the top corner with the outside of his left boot. Keeper no chance.<br>
						Celts almost doubled their lead on a couple of occasions, a couple of long diagonal balls catching the Sala defence flatfooted on more than one occasion, 2 shots flashing just over the upright.<br>
						As the Celts began to tire towards the end, Sala began to exert more pressure on Aki who was finally beaten with just 9 minutes on the clock.A a cross from the right caught the Celts defence flat-footed and the Sala winger nipped in to tuck home.<br>
						The remainder of the game was played out without much further incident, with the Celts left to rue what might have been in the FJ Cup, late goals v France and Sala costing them progression to the quarter finals.<br>

						<b class=red>Promotion Hopes End In a Whimper</b><br>
						The slim promotion hopes of the Saitama Jets and the Dutch Embassy both ended with a 2-2 draw between the teams at Ina on April 9th. The Dutch started strong, and went ahead after a mixup between rookie Jets goalkeeper Fraser Gould and defender Yasu Suyama gifted the Dutch striker an easy chance. The Jets fought back, and went close on a number of occasions, particularly through striker Nate Gildart. The equalizer was a touch fortunate, as midfielder Gary Garner launched a long cross-shot from the right, which sailed over the keeper's head to level the game at 1-1. As half-time neared, the Jets pushed for a second goal, but were hit on the break by a quick Dutch attack which ended with the unmarked Dutch midfielder slotting home to give the men in orange a 2-1 lead.<br>
						In the second half, Saitama laid siege to the Dutch goal. The second equalizer came midway through the half, as striker Ryan Loren's deflected freekick wrong-footed the keeper to square things at 2-2. The Dutch goal then lived a charmed life, as Loren, Mark Eite, midfielder Sasaki, central defender John Rayner and newboy Chris Westrop were all thwarted by the acrobatics of the Dutch goalie.<br>
						It ended 2-2, and both teams will battle away again in Division 2 next season.<br>

					<p><b>Sat April 2nd 2005. OiFuto</b> YCAC comfortably beat an under-strength BFC 3-0 at home on Saturday to climb above the visitors into third in the TML. BFC's early promise turned sour after 20 minutes when YCAC went ahead through an own goal from Ryo Yasunaga. When BFC goalkeeper Sid Lloyd then came for a free kick but failed to gather, allowing Daisuke to head home.

						<b class=red>YCAC exacted some measure of revenge</b> for a 0-5 drubbing back in January with an emphatic 3-0 defeat of BFC on Saturday.<br>
						YCAC were 1st to the ball from the start and never allowed the British defence or midfield the time or space to try to build attacks. With the luxury of 4 subs, to none for BFC, fresh legs allowed YCAC to keep the pace up for 80 minutes, starving the potent BFC strikeforce of quality service. Potential matchwinners Jon Day and Tomo, the TMLs leading scorer, both had quiet days and it was left to Al Himmers aerial prowess and Evans speed to provide the threat to the YCAC goal. The YCAC back 4 were solid thoughout led by a standout performance from Daisuke Ogawa. When the home rearguard was pierced, BFC found Keeper Derrick Bean in outstanding form. On the 1 occasion even he was beaten, Hisao Yasuda was on hand to head a goal bound shot off the line.<br>
						YCAC benefited from scoring at crucial times in the match. The first to kill off a period of sustained BFC pressure; James Absolom won the ball and sent Hisao racing down the left flank. He whipped in a low hard cross into that nasty area between outcoming keeper and retreating defender, Ryo Yasunaga, who was harried by Tom Taw into putting through his own goal. The 2nd and 3rd goals came either side of HT and were both the result of pinpoint freekicks. Phil &quot;The Postman&quot; Denham delivered one behind the BFC defence where Daisuke outjumped Sid to head his 1st goal for the club. 2-0 at HT. Second half sub Ian Robertson was then the recipient of a free kick beautifully chipped over the BFC defence by Damian Hart. Robbo duly slotted the ball past the keeper, exposed for the 3rd time. BFC continued to push forward but were unable to spoil a rare clean sheet for YCAC who, with the 3 points, retake 3rd spot in the table, for the time being at least.<br>
						Later that evening......Marcel Niederhauser and Joe Takeda were voted YCAC Clubman of the Year and Player of the Year, respectively. Congratulations to them<br>

						<b class=red>France overcome BEFC with (arguably) 'Goal of the season'</b><br>
						The strength of the FranceFC squad was evident on Saturday 2nd April against BEFC where despite missing a number of players the team, were still able to field 13 quality reprobates. With Nicolas out for season, Yannick&#26;s P and B, Gilles, Laurent's F and G, Gildas and Pierre (to name just a few) also absent the assembled team had a slightly different but still strong look about it.<br>
						The BEFC team also looked to have a few players missing from the previous game and so the game kicked off with both teams wanting the three points for different reasons. France FC were desperate to get back to winning ways after a few reversals and draws recently whereas the BEFC were even more desperate due to their perilous looking position at the bottom of the table. <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">More...</a><br>

					<p>Saturday morning Apr. 2nd, great day for a game but a 9 am kick-off, ouch! Swiss coming off a tough win over YCAC and Maritizio suffering after a drubbing by the Hibs - a chance for an upset?<br>
						The Swiss were able to call up a couple of legends (Graeme and Aoki) to make up the squad while Maritizio had 10 at the start (got their 11th 10 minutes in). Good fortune seemed to be smiling on the Swiss as the first attack, a long ball from Kirk, knocked on by Karl to the speedy Angelo led to a well taken shot and a 1-0 lead with only a few minutes gone. After that, the game settled down into a more regular tempo with the Swiss midfield (James, JP, Pratt, Spiers, Suzuki) controlling and creating chances but many were being missed. Coming back the other way, Maritizio were getting through with some quick counter attacks and some disorganized marking but Graeme, the Swiss hard man, and speedy Kai were closing chances down. By the end of the first half, the Swiss produced 3 more goals. Graeme scored from distance after a clearance from a corner with a dipping shot into the upper left hand corner. Karl banged a nice shot home from inside the box and Suzuki scored after dribbling the ball himself, not passing to the man who was offside, and shooting into the lower right hand corner. Dave Pratt looked to have a couple of chances as well but whether it was own teammates crowding him or that deceptive skill factor rearing its ugly head, I guess we just have to wait until he does knock one in to find out. The highlight of the first half was actually a defensive stop by our unsung hero over the past 4 games, Uchida in goal. Maritizio counter attacked and a forward got around Dave Spiers into the penalty area. Dave didn't see the 6'5&quot; defender closing down the attacker's options (didn't hear the silent stalker either) so he decided to bring him down from behind - Ricky pointed straight to the penalty spot. Vernon steps up to side foot it to the right - Uchida dives and palms the ball away to safety, brilliant! The 2nd half produced more of the same but laziness and poor finishing led to some frustration for the Swiss. In the end, Angelo scored on a well taken volley Karl banged it in from close range to produce a 6-0 victory. Frustrating day for Maritizio but the Swiss midfield was too strong and the defense was solid again - some good goals are always nice.<br>
