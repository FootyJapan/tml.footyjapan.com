				<td><H2 class=red>MARITIZIO SCRAPE IN!</h2>
				<P><b>Sun February 27th 2005.</b>YCAC1 got past Maritizio by just the odd goal for the 3rd time this season. This time a 2-1 win on Sunday in sunny Yokohama confirmed YCAC as the winners of Group A in 
				the FJ Cup. The Maritzio goal, however, scored in the last minute seems to have put them into the QF as well allowing them to sneak past Shane by 1 goal difference into 2nd place in the Group.<BR>
				As in last weeks game. Maritizio were quicker out of the blocks than the home team and had the better of the opening 20 minutes. Also like last week, however, failure to hit the target when they had the 
				chance would cost them dear later in the game.<BR>

					<p>YCAC had the better of the 2H and got 2 goals from free kicks. The 1st from Phil Denham, found its way via the post, to the feet of James Absolom who finished without fuss from close range. The second was a sublimely struck shot from Joe Takeda which the Keeper barely saw. YCAC had a number of chances to get a 3rd and put the result beyond doubt, but the Maritzio keeper made several fine saves to deny them.<br>
						With both sides seemingly resigned to finishing at 2-0. The Maritizio Center Half got his head to a last minute free kick and steered in the goal which looks to have given his team passage to the knock out stages of the Cup at the expense of TML Div 2 Shane.<br>

						<b class=blue>JETS POWER THROUGH</b><br>
						The Saitama Jets beat NOVA by two clear goals for the second time this season to ensure qualification for the second stage of the Footy Japan Cup. The final result was 3-1 to the men from Saitama, although the game was a lot closer than the scoreline suggests. NOVA bossed the first half, and created three or four clear-cut chances which were admirably saved by Jets keeper Fraser Gould. The Jets had pace and precision in attack, and Ryan Loren and Mike Passmore both threatened, without managing to beat the NOVA keeper. Then, a few minutes before half-time, the Jets won a corner on the left. Mark Eite curled it over the defenders and was as surprised as anyone to see it sail over the goalie and into the top corner. 1-0 at half-time, and NOVA could feel a bit unlucky.<br>
						The second half was very open, with both teams attacking quickly and in numbers. Eite scored his second for the Jets, coolly finishing after an accurate long ball from Tomohiro Saito. NOVA pressure eventually paid off, after two strikers were left on their own in the 6-yard box, and one of them slotted the ball home easily. NOVA pressed for an equalizer, but instead it was the Jets who struck the final blow, through a long-range effort from Saito.<br>

						<b class=red>SHANE AVENGE CUP DEFEAT.</b><br>
						On a good day for football, Shane met Barbarians for the second time this season. The Barbarians winning the previous encounter 3-2 in the cup. As a result of this Shane were determined to take all three points from this mid-table clash. Shane started very brightly playing some excellent football without providing any real end product; the Barbarians marshalled their defence very well and were able to hit Shane on the break on a couple of occasions. The first half gradually heated up and Shane started to dominate the match producing some good chances but nothing that threatening.<br>
						The second half started much as the first half had ended with Shane really piling on the pressure. Shane eventually took advantage with a clinical finish from Alex Thompson after an excellent cross from Dave Jones. Shane pushed on and nearly found a second after Neil willis grazed the bar from 25 yards.<br>
						The last fifteen Shane seemed to run out of steam which resulted in some spirited attacking from the Barbarians; however this time there were no last minute goals and Shane deserved there hard fought victory.<br>

				<P><b>Sat February 26th 2005.YC&amp;AC</b>France FC needed the full 80 minutes to squeak past the Kanto Celts (1-0) in their last game of the TML group stages. <BR>
				A win was a must for the French to proceed to the knockout stages but the excellent Kanto Celts keeper was having a career day and pulled out numerous saves to thwart the French attacks. Whilst the 
				France FC boys had most of the ball and probably the better chances during the game, the Celts were tackling hard and striking fast on the counter. The Celts even struck the crossbar from a freekick with 
				less than 5 minutes left. Then whilst the fat lady was clearing her vocal chords, Nicolas Bozzi's overhead kick from about 8yds was only parried by the Celts goalkeeper into his own net. The French 
				could finally count on some luck but the Celts were unlucky too lose.<BR>

				<td><H2 class=red>YCAC EDGE MARITIZIO TO GO 3rd!</h2>
				<P><b>Sun February 20th 2005. YC&amp;AC</b> A low drive from the edge of the penalty area by James Absolom was enough to give YCAC all 3 points on Sunday at Yokohama. The 1st half was an even affair but with Maritzio creating the better 
				scoring chances. Wayward shooting let them down, though, and YCAC were happy to turn round at 0-0. Despite dominating territorially in the 2nd period, YCAC were unable to get shoot straight either and it looked like it might finish the 
				way it started until 10 minutes from time when Absolom settled it.<BR>
				Damian Harts towering performance in defence marked a very welcome return to YCAC 1st team action. There was very little else to write home about, unfortunately, with both sides struggling on a cloying surface. Better luck next week when 
				the 2 teams meet again in their final group games in the FJ Cup.<BR>

				As the previous days weather cancelled all of the TML fixtures, there was some doubt that the match between Sala and the Geckoes would kick off as planned. However, by 3PM the weather gave way enough for the game to get underway, albeit 
				still with light rain and, at times, strong winds. Neither team was at full strength and only a few frantic phone calls in the morning ensured the Geckoes would have 12 for kick off.<BR>

					<p><b>Sun February 13th 2005. OiFuto</b> Only late on Friday night did staff at the TML operations center discover a mistake in Sundays match times, the time given being 2 hours later than the actual ground booking. Frantic emails went out followed by phonecalls on Saturday morning luckily saving the fixture for Shane vs Clash. Thanks Clash for giving Shane FC time to make the new fixture and apologies to all involved for our slip-up, but not bad considering it's the 1st time in over 200 matches! Please inform us if you see any mistakes on this site with the fixtures, scores etc.<br>
						<b>ed</b><br>
						<b class=red>Clash share Geckoes PK woes!</b><br>
						Both teams were even on points and the match was important to slightly pull away from the rather large bottom group of the division. At match start the Clash sported 13 eager players while Shane only had eight, their keeper not among them. Instead of going for the quite obviously easy win, as Shane had enough players to play the game, Clash agreed to wait for the remaining players in a good sportsman like fashion.<br>
						Half an hour later the keeper had arrived together with one more player and the game could start. Around ten minutes later the final player entered the pitch and both teams were fully numbered.<br>
						Throughout the game Clash seemed to have the edge with more possesion, but it was Shane that had the greater chances. Just like in the Geckoes vs Hibs game, the defence made a slight mistake which the opposing team took advantage of with a nice running ball resulting in the striker being alone with the keeper, and Shane was in the lead with one goal. Clash fought hard to gain an equalizer and halfway in the second half got a PK. Again, just like in the Geckoes vs Hibs game, the PK was wasted and Shane could walk away from the ground with a victory.<br>

						<b class=blue>JETs too much for YC&amp;AC 2nds.</b><br>
						The Saitama Jets continued to put pressure on the other teams fighting for promotion from Division 2 with a comfortable 5-1 victory over the YCAC 2nd team. A hat-trick from Jets' leading scorer Ryan Loren and 2 from club captain Mark Eite were enough to give the Jets a deserved 5-0 lead at half-time. The second-half was much closer, and YCAC even scored a consolation goal, but the first-half blitz was enough to send the men from Saitama home satisfied.<br>

						<b class=red>YC&amp;AC moving up!</b><br>
						YCAC1 climbed to the giddy heights of 4th place in TML1 after a 2-1 win over Jetro on Sunday. The nosebleeds may not last for long with teams around them having games in hand but is welcome enough after a miserable 1st 2 months of the season.<br>
						The game was close only in terms of the scoreline. YCAC dominated and the 2nd half, particularly, was pretty much one way traffic. It was the Jetro Red Army that drew 1st blood however with a scrambled goal following a corner. Richie Whitlock made sure YCAC went to HT on even terms, however,&nbsp;with a superb individual equalizer. He curled one in from a difficult angle off the far post after twisting a couple of Jetros inside out. Tony Hopwood put YCAC ahead when he flashed in a close range header half way through the 2H and it was to stay at 2-1 despite the home sides best efforts to get a 3rd. Both Will Richards, with a dipping volley, and James Absolom, with a towering header, rattled the&nbsp;crossbar as Jetros goal was laid siege throughout the half.<br>
						With MOM Joe Takeda pulling all the strings in midfield Jetro were denied the chance to mount any concerted attempts to repeat their comeback earlier in the season at YCAC when they scored twice in the last 3 minutes to force a 4-4 draw.<br>

				<td><H2 class=red>SWISS &amp; HIBS PLAY LEAPFROG!</h2>
				<P><b>Sat February 12th 2005. Hachioji park</b>Swiss kickers briefly regained their position at the top of Div 1 by defeating Sala FC 3-0 in a tough battle. Their stay 
				at the top was short lived though as Hibernian scraped past Geckoes 1-0 in the following match with the latter having missed a 2nd half PK - their 4th missed PK out of 
				4 this season!!<BR>

				<b class=blue>Ono saves the win for Hibs.</b><BR>
				Tokyo Hibernian regained their place at the top of the table, downing Wall Street Geckoes 1-0 in a lively affair Saturday evening. Hib's striker Daniel Melo bagged the 
				only goal mid way through the first half after some nice build up play from Andy Milner and Kuni Katase. The Geckoes fought hard throughout, with their keeper making 
				several good saves to deny the Hibs a buffer zone. <BR>With ten minutes remaining the Geckoes striker nicked an under-hit back pass and was fouled by a Hibs defender. The 
				foul looked to have begun and finished outside the penalty area, but the referee awarded a penalty. Geckoes' midfielder stepped up and sent Hibs' keeper Ono keeper the 
				wrong way, but he somehow managed to save well with his feet. The penalty rebound lead to another free kick on the edge of the area. The free kick was crossed in and 
				headed goal ward but Hib's defender Kenji headed clear off the line and the Hibs held on for the win.<BR>

				<b class=red>Sala dominate but can't crack Swiss.</b><BR>
				The Sala express, unbeaten in three, was derailed in deepest Saitama by old foes the Swiss.<BR>
				On a blemish free artificial surface, well suited to Sala's fluid passing style, hopes were high for a victory over a team who had just lost the league leadership.  
				Things did not quite turn out that way however. Mere minutes into the first half, Sala found themselves in the now customary position of being a goal down.    A Corner 
				from the right was met by the giant Swiss centre-half, captain Kirk, who glanced a header in off the far post. 0v1. <BR>
				The only positive thing that could be said was that it was the best possible time to lose a goal, and with the whole game ahead of them, Sala didn't panic....

				<td><H2 class=blue>NOVA TOPPLE SHANE IN EIKAIWA BATTLE</h2>
				<P><b>Sun February 6th 2005.</b>On a chilly Sunday night Nova FC were able to finish off a scrappy affair with Shane FC with a well taken goal in the last 2 minutes of play. Nova started the game the brighter 
				of the two sides and took the game to the Shane defense. After 20 minutes of pressure Nova were finally rewarded with a spectacular volley off a cornerkick by Chiba Tom. This 
				spurred Shane into action as they took control at the end of the first half and were unlucky not to go into the break even after a wonderful diving save by the Nova keeper. <BR>
				The second half saw Shane continue to take the game to Nova (partly due to starting the second half with 9 men due to Skyler and Jeremy's inability to get control of their 
				bladders).   The ball was continually sent into the Nova end and after 20 minutes of pressure Shane were able to tie the game when their striker tapped in a loose ball 3 meters 
				from the line. The goal seemed to wake Nova FC up as they took control of the last 15 minutes finally breaking the deadlock with a deft inside flick off a shot from the edge of 
				the box by Matt Van Niekerk. <BR>
				2-1 final score, allowing Nova FC to get their first win of 2005. <BR>

				<B class=red>Vags Win Basement Battle</B><BR>
				Two second half strikes by the Metropolis League's own Sid Lloyd were enough to give the BFC Vagabonds a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers AFC Wanderers at Oi Futo on Sunday evening. 
				A very even first half had seen the Vags go ahead early after fine work on the right by Mike Yeomans led to a debut goal for Vags new boy Ross. Midway through the half the 
				Wanderers got a deserved equalizer from a well-taken free kick that curled unerringly into the top left corner of the goal and the sides went into the break all square, which was 
				fair enough.<BR> 
				The second half saw the Vags hold onto the ball better and create the lion's share of chances. However, it wasn't until late on that Sid latched on to a Lyndsey Hughes pull back 
				and drove in from ten yards out. Minutes later El Sid half-volleyed a rebound into the roof of the net after his initial shot had been well saved by the Wanderers' keeper. 3-1 to 
				the Vagabonds, which was also fair enough.<BR>

				<B class=blue>TENACIOUS GECKOES CLAW BACK POINT</B><BR>
				An entertaining TML 1 encounter between YCAC1 and Wall St. Geckoes ended honours even at 3-3 on Sunday. Joe Takedas deadball expertise with either foot caused problems for the Geckoes defence all day. He put corners onto 
				both Rob O'Grady and Tony Hopwoods heads for 2 of the home teams goals. The other was another header, this time Richie Whitlock headed home directly from a James Absolom long throw.<BR>
				Three times YCAC had their noses in front only to be hauled back each time by a spirited Geckoes team. Wall Street found their own dead ball specialist with HT substitution Leonardo. His sweetly struck free kick cannoned 
				back off of a post but was lashed  in by  a fast reacting colleague to bring the score to 2-2. Then, after Tony Hopwood had restored YCACs lead, Wall St. got another free kick within shooting range. Shaping to shoot again, 
				Leonardo squared the ball to a colleague who whipped in a short cross right on to Captain Simons head right on the YCAC line. Just how centre halves like their chances; 3-3 and a point was no more than the Geckoes deserved<BR>

				<B class=blue>HIBS GO TOP WITH SWISS SLIP UP</B><BR>
				<b>Sat February 5th 2005.</b> Swiss Kickers were held to a goalless draw against Jetro FC in an early morning match at Oi Futo, giving Hibs the chance to regain the lead 
				in the title race.<BR>
				The Swiss, were guilty of squandering the chances they had and were forced to share the points with the Stalemate Kings Jetro who've now had 6 draws 
				in their 12 matches.<BR>
				At YC&amp;AC, Barbarians were the latest team to be knocked out of the FJ Cup, losing 1-0 to Maritizio. It's still not a dead cert for Maritizio though as they need a draw 
				with YCAC to ensure progression to the next round! For the FJ Cup tables, <a href="javascript:popwindow('mats/popups/FJCup05format.html','top=10,left=10,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">click here.</a><BR>

				After last week's comeback against France, there was no hangover for the Hibs as they beat the struggling embassy outfit 4-0 on a brilliant day at St Mary's.<BR>
				BEFC lined up to frustrate and were playing with most of their players behind the ball, which lead to a break down in most Hibs attacks. Just before half time the Hibs finally broke through with Kuni Katase heading home from short range after a goal mouth scrap.<BR>
				In the second half Kuni Katase again showed his predatory instincts to finish a rebound off the post from Mick O'Hagan's powerful shot. Kuni Hosoi thumped in one from 25 yards and Daniel Melo finally got the goal he had been due.<BR>
				With the Swiss slipping up against Jetro, the run to the end of the season looks like going down to the wire.<BR>
				<b>Bevan Colless</b><BR>
				<B class=red>BFC held 2-2 after controversial Sala strike</B><BR>
				Sala snatched a 2-2 draw against BFC with a controversial late goal in the Footy Japan Cup on Saturday. Sala had taken the lead against the run of play after 20 minutes 
				when BFC failed to clear a free-kick and Paul Clarke stabbed home from close range. BFC equalised on the stroke of halftime when Tomomitsu Kunii set up Alastair Himmer, 
				who blasted home from eight yards out. <BR>
				BFC took a deserved lead 10 minutes into the second half when right-back Tom Kennedy tucked in at the neat post after a well-worked move. But Sala grabbed a share of the 
				spoils when Brian Gallagher nudged the ball out of BFC goalkeeper Sid Lloyd's hands to poke the ball home. All BFC can hope for is that Kanto Celts can beat either Sala or 
				France FC otherwise their run in the cup is over.<BR>
