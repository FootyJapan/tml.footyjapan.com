				<p>The British Football Club unceremoniously disposed of a Wall Street Geckoes team 2-0 in the final of the Footy Japan Charity 6s tournament held at and co-hosted by
				YC&amp;AC on March 21.<BR><BR><img src="http://footyjapan.com/mats/photos/05/6s@ycac.jpg" width="570" height="190" border="0"><BR>
				Having scored only 2 goals to win their group, it wasn't until the knockout stages of the tournament that BFC found their scoring ways dismissing a determined Mitsubishi
				Bank FC 1-0 in the semi-final. In the other semi-final the gritty WS Geckoes managed to beat the Swiss Kickers on penalties after the teams were tied at full-time. <BR>
				2 first half goals by the BFC striker were enough to put an end to the WS Geckoes chances of glory, but the runners-up are, in tournaments and league games, forever
				proving that they have what it takes to upset the big guns.<BR>

				17 teams took part in the charity event and with thanks to the generous support of all the organizations sponsoring the event (some of whom, opting for a per-goal
				contribution, may well have been wincing as 110 goals were netted on the day) including: Barclays Capital, Shinsei Bank, Lloyds TSB and Wall Street Associates, not to
				mention the players themselves, the tournament managed to raise &#165;330,000. This money will go directly to UNICEF to help children still suffering in areas devastated by
				the Tsunami last December.<BR>
				Footy Japan would like to thank in addition to the sponsors mentioned above, all the players for taking part in this event and scoring the goals to raise the cash.
				Footy Japan would also like to thank YC&amp;AC for their support and use of their illustrious facility and a great buffet, Stella Artois for the (free) beer, Coca Cola
				for the free soft drinks, 1066 and Mr Yannick for the bacon butties and kebabs.<BR>

				<td><H2 class=blue>HIBS KEEP THE RACE TIGHT!</h2>
				<P><b>Sun March 27th 2005. OiFuto</b> After 6 weeks of no league games this was a good chance for the Hibs to get some more points on the table. 10 minutes in
				and Kuni Katase nicked the ball off a short Maritzio goal kick. Kuni steadied himself and finished very well near post from a tight angle to settle the nerves. 1-0 to
				the Hibs. 5 minutes later the Hibs were awarded a free kick about 30 metres out on the right hand side; this was definitely in Kuni Hosoi territory. Kuni probably
				didn't hit it as well as he usually does but a goal mouth scramble ensued and Jorgen bundled to ball over the line from 2 yards after good scrapping by Ike in the mixer,
				2-0 to the Hibs and the Maritzio heads went down. The Maritzio defence then decided it was much easier to step up in a line and call for off side. Soon after, a long
				clearance from Ike was headed down by Mitsu into Keita's path and he ran the ball 20 meters and finished well from the left side.<BR>
				3-0 to the Hibs at half time and the game was effectively over as a contest. Not long into the 2nd half and Daniel headed goal wards from a corner but the ball landed
				almost directly on Kuni K's head and in it went to make it 4-0. Keita then laid on 2 goals for Bevan and Daniel to make it a nice even 3-0 to the Hibs in both halves. In
				the run in to the end of the year this keeps things very interesting between the Swiss and the Hibs.<br>

					<p>Tomo Kunii struck twice as BFC came back from a goal down to beat France FC 3-2 in a crunch TML game on Saturday. France took an early lead through Pablo Gularte's penalty, awarded after a needless foul. But BFC levelled quickly with Kunii whipping in a right-wing cross and Alastair Himmer powering a header in from just inside the penalty box. Kunii then made it 2-1 himself but France equalised through Oliver Worsfold's header on the stroke of halftime.<br>
						BFC increased the pressure in the second half and Brian Doyle volleyed over from point-blank range. The winning goal came after 70 minutes when Jon Day's through ball eluded the French defenders and Kunii arrived to head in at the back post for a deserved victory.<br>

						<b class=blue>&quot;Swiss-Roll over YCAC&quot;</b><br>
						Familiar pun, all too familiar story on saturday as the Swiss just had a little too much of everything for YCAC.<br>
						Both sides were obviously missing regulars to holiday commitments and the bare elevens were found thanks only to Kirks little black book of Kanto footballers and the local Yokohama High School, respectively. Both also had the pleasure, though, of welcoming back departed heroes for the game. Neither Ian Brown-Peterside or Graeme Lane actually scored but both managed to give the opposition defence a more difficult afternoon that they might have anticipated.<br>
						The pace of YCACs front 2 of Graeme and Tom Taw looked initially capable of upsetting the redoubtable Swiss rearguard. The 1H saw chances made and spurned by both sides with IBP, in particular, missing the target by about a foot on a couple of occasions. The only person who didn't miss was actually trying to. James Batten swung in a corner from the left which flew unaided into the YCAC net. 1-0 to the Swiss at HT who then proceeded to take a firmer grip of things after the interval<br>
						As YCAC pushed further forward in search of the equalizer more and more space appeared for Swiss counter-attacks. With Dave Pratt pulling the strings the Swiss could and should have put the game beyond all doubt by midway through the half. They didn't though. Another excellent performance from Damian Hart at the heart of YCACs defence, the crossbar (twice) and, particularly, some very ordinary shooting from the Swiss conspired to leave the score at 1-0.<br>
						It didn't seem that the Swiss could find a way to add to the total and both sides were beginning to suspect that it might not be their day. YCAC didn't help themselves when they might of nicked a goal, though. As well as the Back three defended, their distribution was lacking after the ball had been won resulting in poor service to the front men. Anything that did get through was dealt with by Kirk who was in particularly commanding form in the 2H<br>
						As time ran out the result was finally sealed by a 2nd Swiss goal from a corner. This one floated harmlessly over all the 6 footers and landed directly at the feet of the smallest attacker in the box who knocked it straight in, sparing the blushes of his forwards. 2-0 to the Swiss...... again<br>

				</table><P><b>Sun March 20th 2005. OiFuto</b> Swiss vs. Geckoes on the day before the big Charity Tournament. Both teams seemed to be missing a few players but it didn't make the
				game any less intense. The 2 teams had only played to a draw 3 weeks earlier in the Cup and were pretty familiar with each other. The Geckoes strength lay with a solid
				back four, some Latin creativity in midfield, and the big Japanese striker and speedy Englishman up front. The Swiss counter with no real standouts but a lot of movement
				and overlapping from defense and midfield which can open holes up if your midfielders don't stay with their man. <br>The Swiss had been frustrated in the recent draw after dominating the first half only to see it slip away with a
				very strong comeback by the Geckoes and some sloppy defending. This time, the Swiss opened up the
				first half in similar fashion, scoring after only 5 minutes with converted striker Mori receiving a through ball from Krando, beating 2 defenders and slipping it by the keeper.

				<b class=blue>Bad day at the office.</b><BR>
				Having had a bit of a good run recently, the Geckoes took on the Swiss at Oi beach on Sunday afternoon feeling that another shock could be on the cards. For the first 10-15 minutes it was fairly even and things were looking good for the Geckoes. But then the Swiss took charge. Their first goal came from a defensive error that allowed their winger to waltz through the Geckoes defence before slotting the ball home. Their second came from a corner with Karl Hahne volleying home having been left unmarked.<BR>
				In the second half, it was more of the same, a lot more! With the Swiss attacking constantly and the Geckoes trying to stop them. Things improved briefly when Rob saved a Karl Hahne penalty but that was as good as it got for the Geckoes. After that, the Swiss continued to pepper the Geckoes goal, scoring twice, missing a few and having several saved by Rob.<BR>
				In the end, the Geckoes were exceptionally fortunate that they could walk off with just a 4-0 drubbing.<BR>

				<td><H2 class=red>WORRIES MOUNT AS RAIN POSTPONES MORE MATCHES.</h2>
				<P><b>Sat March 12th 2005. OiFuto</b> The light smattering of rain on Friday afternoon was enough to cause Oi Sports center to close it's pristine dirt pitch all day Saturday, putting further pressure on
				the already strained fixture list. With other grounds closing for renovation and the Japanese leagues starting, there are now very few locations available for 'gaijin' that are suitable for league fixtures.
				With 41 league matches &amp; 8 cup matches left to play, it looks like the league will run into late June unless new grounds can be found! <BR>
				Having hosted the World Cup in 2002, one would have thought conditions
				would have become better for the amateur footballer in Japan, whereas in fact football is just more popular but with very few new facilities to play 11-a-side. The few that are available, usually booked online or by
				lottery (after the FFA &amp; other associations pre-book most of them), have hundreds of teams vying for very few spots, making the process very hit or miss - usually the latter. Some hope is on the
				horizon though, as Komazawa Olympic Park is completing a renovation of 2 of their grounds into astro-turf with floodlights, meaning more available hours and no rain cancellations. But
				then again, in 2 years of trying in the lottery with 12 registered teams, we've only ever achieved one, 4 hour booking on the old dirt pitches there.....<BR>

				</table>
					<p>The game between the Geckoes and the British Embassy got under way as scheduled, Saturday night at 6PM, 3/12, under the lights at Oi Dani. The Geckoes were looking for revenge for an earlier loss a few months ago.<br>
						However, the Embassy started brighter of the two teams and were ahead after just a few minutes as the Embassy's best player and candidate for man-of-the-match, Hitoshi Matsushima broke down the left wing and put a perfect cross into the box which the BEFC newcomer, Michael Crossley headed in giving the Geckoes keeper no chance. That was the wake up call for the Geckoes who increased the pressure and would have been equal on ten minutes as a sure goal was kept out by the Embassy's defender, Warren Daley's hand.<br>

						<b class=blue>SALA STYMIED!</b><br>
						An under strength YCAC1 nicked a point from Sala with a gritty display in Yokohama on Saturday. With more than 50% of the 1st team squad unavailable and&nbsp;Sala looking the business out on the pitch early,&nbsp;resplendent in their new kit, it didn't look like it would be the day when YCAC would avoid defeat against Sala for the 1st time in the TML.<br>
						By the time Sala had gone 2-0 up midway through the 1st half it looked like being a question of how many the rampant Sala forwards would help themselves to. Prompted by intelligent play by their central defenders and surging runs by the mid fielders Sala launched wave after wave of attacks at a desperate YCAC defence. The 3rd goal never came, though, chiefly thanks to a brilliant display from the YCAC Keeper, Derrick Bean, and wayward shooting. YCAC's ambitions were beginning to change from avoiding a cricket score to hanging on at 0-2 to HT when they got a goal back. Gavin Margetson was on hand to stab home a loose ball in the 6 yard box to record his 1st goal for YCAC's 1st team.<br>
						YCAC reorganized a tad in the 2nd half, putting an extra body in the midfield to try and staunch the flow of service to the Sala front line. With Phil Denham getting a grip in midfield and&nbsp;Kaz Matsumoto and Ken Sakae harrying the Sala backline, Sala had a more difficult job launching their attacks. Nevertheless, Sala seemed to have an endless supply of attacking options off the bench and all the combinations they tried seemed to work. Some neat passing and interchanges continued to keep the YCAC defence on the back foot. Derrick Bean, however, had gotten even better in the 2nd half and Salas shooting hadn't so the score stayed at 1-2 until 10 minutes from the end. It was YCAC who scored, though, with Gavin Margetson side footing home from the edge of the box for his 2nd of the game.<br>
						It stayed at 2-2 for Salas 1st draw of the TML season but no doubt viewed in the Sala Bar in Chiba as 2 points dropped<br>
						<b>Steve Taw</b><br>
						<b class=red>CELTS KEEP THE PROMOTION RACE WIDE OPEN</b><br>
						Kanto Celts had a deserved victory at a sunny YCAC on Saturday morning to keep the pressure on the teams around them in the race for promotion from Div 2. Celts, who managed to scrape together 11 players barely minutes before kick off began brightly and almost scored from their first attack when Damo unleashed a volley on goal which just missed the post. With Seamus and Tom dominating the centre of the park, it was only a matter of time before the Celts scored. Keeper/stand in striker Ally latched on to an excellent through ball by Tom, to lash past the young YCAC keeper. From then on the YCAC Goal led a charmed life with Ally and Tom both hitting the woodwork. YCAC worked hard but were unable to break through a strong Celts defence. The only surprise was that the Celts were unable to add to their tally.<br>
						The second half was more of the same, with Celts keeper rarely troubled, although it took an excellent clearing header from Conama to deny YCAC a goal which would have been against the run of play. Tom struck the underside of the crossbar with a fine turn and shot, and Ally again hit the post, YCAC keeper also making a couple of decent saves. It ended up 1-0 to the Celts, keeping the pressure up on the teams around them, although disappointing that they couldn't improve their GD tally, which may prove vital at the end of the season.<br>

				<P><b>Sun March 6th 2005.Nodai</b>Maritizio snatched an injury-time winner to beat a depleted BFC team 3-2 in deepest Saitama on Sunday. BFC looked to have secured a deserved point after Tomo Kunii's  late
				penalty but a determined Maritizio bundled home the winner in a goalmouth scramble at the death.<BR>
				In a game of controversial penalty decisions, Maritizio went ahead from the spot after a  trip by BFC  goalkeeper Sid Lloyd, sparking protests from the blues about a shove on defender Tom Kennedy that went
				unpunished. Lloyd went the wrong way, 1-0 Maurizio. At the other end, BFC  had a legitimate shout for a penalty when Jon Day was bundled off the ball but they equalised through a fine header from Pablo
				Pomares. Missing five regular first-team players, BFC had their chances but slack defending saw Maurizio retake the lead midway through the second half. Kunii's penalty five minutes from time restored
				parity again but BFC were sent tumbling to their third defeat of the season while Maurizio climbed off the foot of the TML's first division. <a href="http://www.BFCTokyo.com%20target=blank">More...</a><BR>

				Nodai was the setting for a very importing game which Maritizio's simply had to win to sustain some form of hope for staying in contention to escape the relegation zone.  On a fine Sunday morning
				therefore, the scene was set for this showdown with BFC who could be forgiven for assuming that it would be just another walk in the park. Indeed, how wrong this turned out to be.
