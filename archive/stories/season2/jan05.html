						YCAC caught Shane with a sucker punch late in the game, however. Joe Takeda used the old 1-2 to deliver the knock-out late in the game when he finished off a flowing counter attack.<br>
						Shane had fought a good fight but were forced to throw in the towel and it finished 2-0.<br>

						<b class=red>HIBS SHOCK FRANCE WITH STUNNING COMEBACK!</b><br>
						<b>St. Mary's, January 29.</b> After their recent victories over the Swiss and the BFC, the inform France FC were looking to go into 3rd place in the TML with a victory over the Hibs at St Mary's.<br>
						France FC jumped out of the blocks running with a great goal after 10 minutes to Gilles Soulie, who volleyed a looping ball on the turn to leave Hibs' Ono with no chance. Les Bleus then went 2-0 ahead as Lahiani headed next to the near post from a well struck corner and it remained 2-0 to France FC until half time. Hibs' talented Josh Schirmer had the kick off times mixed up and arrived for the game just before half time. He made amends for his tardiness 2 minutes into the second half with a thumping drive from 20 yards that put the Hibs back in it at 2-1. Not 5 minutes into the second half and Ricky the Ref awarded a penalty against France for handball. Narama sent the keeper the wrong way and it was 2-2 with 35 minutes to play. Despite the Hibs hitting the post and several near misses it remained at 2-2 until virtually the last kick of the game. The Hibs' received a free kick just inside their half and Kuni Hosoi over-hit a long speculative ball designed to land right &quot;in the mixer&quot;. The French keeper 'Elbow' somehow managed to let the ball slip through his grasp and into the net giving Hibs all the points and the French a bad taste in their mouth.<br>

						A 9'o'clock start was always a tall order in darkest January, but the weather turned out to be clement. Sunny with a breeze and clear blue skies, the only problems being the glare from the low sun, and the pitch.<br>

				<P><B>Sun January 23rd 2005, YC&amp;AC. </B>YCAC1 came out on top of a proverbial 6 pointer with BEFC on Sunday morning in Yokohama. A convincing 3-0 win puts some welcome daylight between the   boys in blue and white and the 2 relegation places in TML Div 1.<BR>
				PJ Park teed up a 1st TML goal for Will Richards and   helped himself to 2 to leapfrog the pack to go to the top of the TML1 scoring charts. BEFC defended resolutely with both centre backs, in particular, having fine games. They were unable to pose any sort of threat at the other end, however, where debutant Dickie Philo and keeper Derrick Bean were both in commanding form.<BR>
				After last weeks debacle against BFC, YCAC were geared up for a difficult morning with a record 4 subs available but it never came. The snow and icy winds stayed away and fellow strugglers BEFC were dealt with comfortably in the end<BR>

				<h2 class=red>SALA HOLD OFF GECKOES TO CLOSE ON LEADERS.</h2>
				<P><B>Sat January 22nd 2005, OiFuto DaiNi. </B>Another cold winters evening at Oi Futo produced some heated football in the mid-table clash between Sala &amp; Geckoes.
				Sala are still catching up games with the leaders and a win in their final game in hand vs BEFC next week would bring them to 3rd spot.<BR>
				Goals in each half from Dougal Beddington and Roddy Charles were enough to take the points but there were scares in the 2nd half when Chris Waters broke through the Sala defence,
				lobbing the keeper only to see his shot just clear the bar. As the battle heated, there were a few handbags joining in the fray but with Ricky the ref on hand, things were

				Doyle opened the scoring with a rasping volley after 20 minutes but it was not until the second half that BFC began firing on all cylinders. They doubled their lead
				through an own goal on the hour, only for the Celts to pull one back two minutes later.<BR>
				However, BFC restored their two-goal cushion soon afterwards when Himmer sent Day clear and he raced on to beat the Celts goalkeeper with a low angled shot. Collins then made it 4-1 with a carbon-copy strike.<BR>
				Himmer completed the rout in the 90th minute, hooking home from close range after good work from Day.<BR>

					<p><b>Sun January 16th 2005, OiFuto DaiNi. </b>Icy rain greeted the teams at the vast expanse of Oi Futo astro turf pitch as a full day of games went ahead despite the weather. The encounter between Maritizio &amp; the 1st team at YC&amp;AC hadn't faired so well with the water-logged pitch being closed.<br>
						So this was not the day to have 3 players turn up at half time in your match against the top team in your division as happened to the Dutch vs KGFC. With only 9 players in the 1st half, DET were no match for the quick passing KGFC, who took good advantage of the extra men scoring 7 goals. With a full team in the 2nd half, the Dutch held their opposition for 20 minutes, despite having to contend a strong wind as well. However KGFC turned up the pressure again and scored another 5 as the Dutch tired.<br>
						This result put KGFC back to the top of the Division 2 table with a perfect record and Tsuyoshi Fujita's 5 goals put him at the top of the scoring table.<br>
						<b class=red>FASTEST GOAL EVER?</b><br>
						France FC got off to a lightening quick start in their cup game against BFC, when Etsushi Yoshikoshi decided to take advantage of the wind and rain and take a shot from kick-off. His strike went straight for goal, bouncing around the penalty spot, but looked to be covered by BFC keeper Sid. As defenders started to turn away, many a look turned to shock as the ball flew above the hapless keepers head, through his fingertips &amp; into the roof of the net.<br>
						1-0 with only seconds on the clock!<br>

					<p>BFC worked hard to get back into the match, putting together some good passing moves but being unable to finish. Some stout defending by captain Francois &amp; some smart stops by keeper Elliot kept France's goal advantage intact. On the break france looked dangerous and when the BFC defence only partially cleared a corner, no one closed down Pablo Gularte as he lined up to volley from just outside the box. And what a strike it was, into the top right corner from 25 yards not even giving the man still standing on the post a chance. 2-0 at which it stayed until half time.<br>
						In the 2nd half, with the wind behind them, the BFC went out looking for goals but despite numerous attacks they only managed to get 1 goal though a deflected Neil Collins strike. In sending men forward, BFC left themselves exposed at the back and if not for some great defending by stand-ins Steve &amp; Leigh, could quite easily have conceded a third. But 2-1 it was set to finish with France delighted at having wreaked revenge on their old nemesis but BFC feeling unlucky not to have at least earned a draw.<br>

					<p>In freezing rainy conditions the Clash met Vagabonds on the Oi Astroturf with both teams looking for their second win of the campaign. The pitch was very playable at first, and allowed the Clash to knock the ball around well with the new players looking very useful. Not look into the first half, Chris Waters was pushed just outside the box and Phil Stroud stepped up. He curved a great free kick over the wall and into the bottom right corner. The Vags keeper saved but Gino was on hand to turn in the rebound. The Clash soon got a second when Chris Waters intercepted and fed Phil Stroud. His lifted shot was saved only for Waters to dummy the retreating defender on the line and tap in. The second half saw puddles amassing on the pitch and then the match ball going over the fence. The Clash keeper was on hand to stop a number of dangerous situations and then the Clash got their decisive third. Gino fed Phil Stroud who advanced then lifted it through for Waters who was taken out by the keeper but got back up to turn the ball home. The Vags managed to get a goal and threatened for a while but the Clash spurned a lot of chances to kill the game off. Both keepers came out of it having made a number of good saves and the Clash with a deserved victory and a chance to move up the table in the second half of the season.<br>

						A cold and wet day at Oifuto saw the Swiss and Sala lineup for a 4 pm kick off. The Swiss in white and Sala in black. No one really wanted to be on the pitch but recognized the importance of the match as there remained more than half the league's matches to complete. Sala seemed to have their full team ready although Naoki not in the lineup is always a welcome sight. The Swiss fielded a slightly makeshift team with gaps in defense and midfield but the replacements were of good quality. The first half was evenly fought, mostly in midfield as Sala only seemed to be playing with a lone striker.<br>

					<p><b>Sun January 9th 2005, YC&amp;AC. </b>A revitalized BFC 11 made a positive start to the second-half of their TML campaign, following a string of mediocre results, by beating YCAC 5-0.<br>
						Tomomitsu Kunii fired BFC ahead after just 10 minutes following a through ball from mid-field that left the YCAC back four flat-footed. BFC settled into their game and started to connect some useful passes and attacked aggresively.<br>
						Resilient defending by YCAC, including solid play from their keeper, managed to keep out a second goal until ten minutes before half-time when Tomomitsu &quot;flickster&quot; Kunii broke down the left flank and picked out his strike partner Jon Day who finished on the edge of the 6-yard box with a stunning diving header.<br>
						The second half saw more of the same from YCAC - random long balls constantly punted to a frustrated P.J. who, as YCAC's only attacking threat, was marked tightly. BFC pushed forward in search of a 3rd which came courtesy of Evans who having taken the ball round the keeper somehow managed to cut the ball back into the goal from a seemingly impossible angle.<br>
						YCAC looked dangerous from set pieces, in the second half, especially with their aerial prowess on corners. However some astute defending and timely punching from keeper Sid, kept his sheet clean.<br>
						Somewhat inevitably BFC refused to give up their hunt for goals and Jon Day made it 4 when he was played in on goal with only the keeper to beat, which he did with the assistance of a YCAC boot.<br>
						A reckless handball in the area by Joe Takeda would cost YCAC a 5th goal, as Phil Lowes has yet to miss from the spot. Drilling the ball into the top right hand corner, the YCAC keeper could do nothing but watch as the ball and the back of the net made aggresive contact.<br>

							Sun January 9th 2005, OiFuto DaiNi.</b> <b class=red>AFC SUFFER SWISS AGAIN!</b><br>
						The Swiss started off the defense of the Cup in the same way it began in '04, the same opponent, and a very similar result. &nbsp;A beautiful day at Oifuto on the turf, thank you to the organizing committee for putting us there. &nbsp;The Swiss had a number of players back that had been missing during our last match against the French (a 1-0 loss), it was on display early with smooth passing around the back, through midfield, leading to some early opportunities. &nbsp;Angelo hit the bar twice and lobbed the keeper twice but lobbed the goal as well. &nbsp;James was sending in nice crosses from the left as well as Aoki from the right while Dave and Dierk were solid in the middle.&nbsp; The Wanderers were playing one man up front but the ball was not getting through to him as clearances were being sent right back in by the Swiss defenders. &nbsp;As was the case in the match last year, the Wanderers' keeper was outstanding - making strong saves (especially a diving stop to keep Krando from scoring a 1 on 1) at the start and never giving up. &nbsp;Unfortunately for him, the pressure from the Swiss was too much. &nbsp;After numerous squandered opportunities, the first goal came after about 20 minutes gone with Dierk controlling a high cross on his thigh and then volleying into the far corner of the net.&nbsp; After that, the Wanderers' heads started to drop and the goals started to come easier.&nbsp; Aoki scored after a nice cross from Yuji from a short corner.&nbsp; Dierk scored after dribbling around three players in the box and beating the on rushing keeper.&nbsp; Angelo then proceeded to make up for his earlier misses with a couple of nice finishes, one from a breakaway and the other a good shot.&nbsp; The second half was more of the same, the quality dropped a little bit as the intensity did but in the end, Swiss ended up 10-0 winners and look forward to the resumption of league play against Sala next Sunday.<br>

						<b class=blue>JET'S GRAB LATE WIN OVER CELTS</b> The Saitama Jets pulled off an amazing comeback against the promotion-chasing Kanto Celts at Oi, coming from 2-0 with 20 minutes left to win 4-2. The Celts controlled most of the first half, and the Jets were lucky to keep the score to 1-0 at the break. Midway through the second half, the Celts doubled their lead, and looked set for a comfortable victory. The Jets then switched to 3 up front, and veteran midfielder Gary Garner came off the bench to help mastermind the Saitama recovery.<br>
						First, Jets top scorer Ryan Loren slotted home after good work from Sami Noiri in the Celts box. Then, a long pass from Garner picked out Jets captain Mark Eite, who galloped past the last Celts defender and lobbed the onrushing goalkeeper. The 3rd Jets goal came when Garner floated a 30-yard free kick over the wall and keeper into the top corner. A splendid day for the Jets was capped when hardworking midfielder Tomo Kobayashi sliced open the Celts defence with a pinpoint ball, which Mike Passmore gratefully slotted in from close range.<br>
						Having dominated a number of games without being able to kill teams off, the Jets were happy to finally get a slice of luck in the league this season.<br>
