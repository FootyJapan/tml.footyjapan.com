				<P><B>Sat December 18th 2004, YC&amp;AC. </B>Barbarians hopes of upsetting Div 1 YCAC were dashed by a 1st half hat-trick by Tom Taw on Sunday morning in the FJ Cup. The goals all came in an 8 minute burst and effectively ended the game as a contest.<BR>
				Barbarians had no answer to the dynamic duo of Tom Taw and PJ Park upfront and YCAC helped themselves to 2 more goals in the 2nd half, a 4th for Tom Taw and one from Bobby Hegarty, to round out a 5-0 victory<BR>
				<b>Steve Taw</b><BR><BR>
				<b>Did the Barbarians really schmoke the Dutch?</b> On the back of this performance evidently so.This ended up being a terrible day out with both Ian and Clarke leaving the field injured and the team on the wrong end of a 5-0 doing.
				<BR>Unhappy at having abused the YCAC 2nds hospitality a couple of weeks ago in the league the Barbarians were in generous Christmas spirit with the 1sts and seemingly happy to spectate for most of the first half, going in 3 down. The damage came  from; a free header at the back post which Ian did well to parry, but could do nothing about the resultant tap-in; an unstoppable bullet from an unchallnged run into the box; and a daisy-cutter from the edge of the box that somehow trundled in at the far post.
				<BR>The 2nd half saw the Barbarians start to string a few passes together and create a few chances, but  another 2 goals for the YCAC firmly put paid to any previous hopes of a cup upset.<BR>
				So, Merry Christmas to the YCAC 1sts, but in fairness they were the better organised and hungrier of the 2 teams. Anway, would have  been rude to beat the hosts when you know they're going to buy you a beer........<BR>

				leaders but it could have been a heavier defeat had the French taken advantage of their numerous first half chances.<BR><BR>
				The Swiss started the game with many regular faces missing, away for the holidays, and the new look team never looked very confident including the regulars. The French took advantage of this, pressing from the start &amp; creating some 
				good openings. A few kick hit the post and Peter Pauli was called into action on several occasions.<BR><BR>
				The Swiss thought they'd scored in the 2nd half but the final headed touch was ruled as offside. The deadlock was broken when Gularte poked home from 10 yards after the ball had slid through a throng of players to find him unmarked inside 
				the Swiss' box.

				<P><B>Sun December 12th 2004, YC&amp;AC. </B>The drive down from Tokyo to YCAC was rather foreboding as 2 Swiss had cancelled just before departure and the rain starting coming down quite hard as we were 
				passing lovely Kawasaki. Fortunately, the rain never made it to the YCAC and we were able to start in the cold and gray. Kick-off at 10 on a brisk morning, the YCAC seemed a little bit more up for it at 
				the start, winning more loose balls and always going in hard on the challenge. The Swiss clearly aren't comfortable on the hard, bouncy, grass and the YCAC know how to play on it, long balls from the 
				back or crosses in from Damien on the left. On this day, YCAC's two leading scorers were not to be seen at the start with PJ Park having picked up 3 yellow cards and Joe Takeda arriving a little late 
				resulting in a lost starting place.

				related pun here) Swiss. The match began with a bang as the Sala keeper clattered into the Hibs Kuni Katase for a penalty 2 minutes in. The penalty was finished and the Hibs went 1-0 up.  At the 30 minute mark, end to end lead up 
				play by the Hibs lead to Keita Narama beating his man inside the box and smashing the shot into the roof of the net. <BR>
				2-0 to the Hibs at half time, but this was to be a game of 2 halves. Sala piled forwards in the second half and the pressure showed with a well taken free kick leaving the keeper with no chance. Sala had a number of chances but a 
				resolute defence lead to shots from 20-30 yards, some extremely well hit and only for Ono's athleticism unlucky not to score. The Hibs had a breakaway with 5 minutes left, and Narama rounded the keeper, but a fantastic challenge 
				from a Sala defender denied him, and set the stage for a pulsating last 5 minutes. The clock finally ran out and the Hibs hung on in what was an exciting and high quality game.<BR>

					<p><b class=blue>SLIPPERY GECKOES KEEP BFC AT BAY.</b><br>
						An industrious Geckoes 11 fought hard against an undermanned BFC team, to draw 1-1 at Komazawa Park. BFC attacked hard during the first half and had most of the possession in midfield. Geckoes defended resolutely however and managed to clear their lines with some tactile defending and solid play from Rob Keyworth, in goal.<br>
						It wasn't until 10 minutes before the half time whistle that a Ronaldhinio-esque free kick, from BFC striker Pink Neil, that he was lining up as a simple cross into the box, was miss-kicked and somehow found it's way over the keeper's head and in the back of the net. One nil.<br>
						The second half was a different story with Geckoes stepping up a gear. They went on the offensive time and time again and the BFC defense were kept extremely busy. It was all the BFC could do to resort to counter-attacks, as every second touch, as they tried to play out from the back, was a tackle. A moment of madness from Ricky the ref saw him wave play-on when BFC striker Jon Day was unceremoniously felled by the Geckoes keeper as he attempted to take the ball round him. 5 minutes later and following a free-kick and some neat two-touch play from Kazu Kikuchi, Joff Bradley found himself with the ball, unmarked and with all the time in the world to blast home from 6 yards. 1-1.<br>

					<p>WSG started brightly on a glorious winter morning controlling the match until the 20th minute, when a slightly fortuitous goal by BFC Neil Collins broke the deadlock between the two teams. A seemingly innocuous cross from a free kick drifted over the WSG goalkeeper into the net aka David Seaman style, and BFC were 1-0 up. For the next 15 minutes BFC controlled the game and WSG were slightly fortunate not to go two goals down, when a driving run from Collins resulted in WSG keeper Rob Keyworth making a tremendous stop diving low to his right. After the restart WSG held on to the ball well and midway through the second half, levelled the match from a quickly taken free kick. Jonathan Rodrigues picked out the outstanding Kazu Kikuchi who deftly rounded the keeper leaving Joff Bradley a simple tap-in bringing WSG back into the game. With the contest all square, the remainder of the match was played at a considerably augmented tempo. Keyworth, again being called into action making another great save by tipping the ball over the crossbar from the head of Jon Day. The BFC striker was unlucky later on not to have earned his team a penalty, when an another attack resulted in a one on one collision in the WSG 18-yard box. Referee Ricky Matthews, who controlled the match well, disagreed.<br>
						All in all, a good tempered, evenly contested match. WSG had more possession but BFC created better chances.<br>

						<b class=red>BRITISH EMBASSY &amp; FRANCE DEFEND POINTS.</b><br>
						France FC and BEFC battled to a 1-1 scoredraw on a beautiful sunny day at Oi Dirty on Saturday afternoon. The game was a tough and tense affair with precious few chances for the strikers of either side. The BEFC grabbed first blood when the skilful midfielder (No.30) skipped over the last defender's challenge and squeezed the ball past the French goalie from an acute angle. Within 5 minutes the French were level when some good build up play enabled Gilles to break through the BEFC defence and finish with a nice lob/shot. Apart from a few goalmouth scrambles, the defences of both sides ruled the roost from then on and there were no real other chances to mention. The game was well reffed by Kazu and both teams appeared happy if not satisfied with the point apiece.<br>

				<td><h2 class=blue>HIBS SLIP UP AGAINST YC&amp;AC.</h2>
				<P><b>YC&amp;AC, 5th Dec, 2004.</b>YCAC 1 edged reigning TML Champs, Hibs, 2-1 in an open and entertaining match in Yokohama on Sunday. It wasn't an easy day for defenders struggling with strong winds 
				and muddy conditions and both sides carved themselves out plenty of chances throughout the 80 minutes. The feature of the game, however, was excellent goalkeeping from both sides. Time and time again 
				Messrs Ono, for Hibs and Bean and Rodgers, who shared keeping duties for YCAC, came out on top in one on one situtations with opposing forwards.<BR>
				YCAC could have been 2 up early doors if not for Mr Ono's excellence but it was Hibs who took a 1st half lead after Dave Thomas finished off a smart move from close range. YCAC were always in this one, 
				however, and Joe Takeda scored from a penalty to send the teams into half-time all square.<BR><BR>
				Both teams had 2nd half chances to win the game, including a fine stop from a Keita penalty by debutant YCAC GK Gary Hodgson who had a superb 40 minutes. Only PJ Park, however, managed to find the net 
				with a predatory finish with 10 minutes to go and YCAC hung on for the points.<BR>
				End to end stuff ably marshalled by Ref Matthews. A bit of a dent to Hibs hopes of retaining the title, but theres a long way to go yet. Read what the Hibs have to say about it ... <a href="http://www.tokyohibs.com" target="_blank">here</a><BR>

				<b class=red>MARITIZIO GET 1ST WIN</b>
				<BR>Maritizio finally got the win they've been threatening in their last few outings, by overcoming the British Embassy 3-0 on the beautiful Hachioji park ground. It seems all their hard work, finding new players and 
				having training sessions is finally paying off. Jetro FC got their 5th draw (and point) of the season, by holding France FC 0-0. The windy and wet conditions didn't help play, but the French captain 
				put it down to poor finishing. Despite dominating the match &amp; hitting the bar 3 times the French couldn't score, thus dropping a valuable 2 points in their eyes.<BR>
				Saitama JETs also feel the same way after being held by a 10 man Shane team in their Div 2 fixture. JET's  created chances, especially in the 2nd half, but couldn't score. A few cards were handed out, 
				culminating in a red for 1 of the Shane players leaving them with 9, but the JETs couldn't capitalize and the game ended 0-0<BR>
