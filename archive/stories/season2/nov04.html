				</table><P><b>YC&ampAC, 28th Nov, 2004.</b>A late PJ park goal gave YCAC1 a share of the points against France FC on Sunday. The visitors can only blame themselves for not claiming all 3, though. If their finishing in the first half had matched the incisiveness of their build up play then the game would have been out of reach for YCAC by half time. It didn't though and the teams turned round 0-0.<BR>
				Having weathered the storm and begun to get into the game, YCAC conceded a soft one. A mishit cross fooled Derrick Bean in the YCAC goal who could only palm it onto the bar. It dropped right onto Lionel Gies' head  who nodded it in from a yard out<BR>
				France failed to press home the advantage, though   and seemed happy enough with the one goal. A much better 2H YCAC performance seemed to be coming to nothing as the solid French defence dealt with everything thrown at them. They paid the penalty for leaving PJ Park unmarked in the box, however, and his finish earned his team a late point for the 2nd week in a row<BR>
				Well done to Quentin for employing the advantage law and keeping the game flowing. No handbags or whining....must have been the sunshine!<BR>...<a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">more</a> from France FC<BR>

				<BR><b>Yoyogi NHK, 28th Nov, 2004.</b>BFC produced an efficient 3-1 victory over Sala to move third in the TML on Sunday. Rob Day's penalty  midway through the first half gave BFC a deserved lead after sustained early pressure. They doubled their 
				lead when Neil Collins crossed for Evans to head in at the back post 10 minutes into the second half and Tomo made it 3-0 from close range after good work from Jon Day with 15 minutes left. Sala grabbed a late consolation goal 
				through Giles Legg, but it was too late to  stop BFC  making it back-to-back wins after their mid-season wobbles.<BR>

				have been 1-0 inside the first 10 mins when their young striker headed over from a well taken corner. Chances were at a premium at either end with little being given away in midfield and not many 
				questions asked of either keeper. The Swiss finally nicked one as halftime approached with a great shot from top scorer Karl Harne after being well found by fellow forward Angelo.<BR>
				The second half was much of the same, lots of huff and puff, but not very much to show for it. The Swiss almost made it 2-0, but a quite magnificent save from the Gecko's keeper Rob, kept them in the game. They 
				were rewarded 5 mins later when Karl made it 2 for 2 from the spot after Angelo was pulled from behind in the box. The Gecko's worked hard to get back in the game, and created several chances which on another 
				day may have sneaked in. It was left to JP from the Swiss to wrap the points up in the dying mins with a deflected shot that looped over the keeper.<BR>

				team, who took the lead with an impressive breakaway goal on the quarter hour mark. Hibs squandered several good chances from set pieces but lacked the penetration in open play to break down the tight Copel defence. The second half 
				was a different story though, as Hibs started to make better use of the big astroturf pitch and began to find holes in the opposition defence. Dave Thomas led the now-customary Hibs comeback with two fine opportunist strikes, and

				It didn't seem to be BEFC's day as they lost their centre-half and Captain, Rob flynn, to injury early on and, despite having the better of the 1st half, conceded a late goal to  turn round at 1-2. Joe Takeda scored  with a fine 
				low drive through a crowd of bodies almost at the whistle after a an exquistely placed lob (desperate up n under?) from BEFC had cancelled out Pj Parks 1st goal.<BR>

				<P><b>14th Nov, 2004.</b> A very welcome return to YCAC by Grame Lane proved the difference between YCAC1 and Maritzio on Sunday afternoon in Yokohama. "The Skipper" weighed in with 2 late, late goals that put paid to a
				 skillful and spirited performance by Maritzio which belied their position at the bottom of the  TML.<BR>
				Maritzio might have shaded a fast paced 1st half but clear cut chances were few and far between and the 2 teams turned round at HT 0-0. Just as YCAC were gaining the upper hand in the 2nd half they yet again let in 2 quick goals 
				from corners. The second a good low strike back  after a weak clearance, the first directly from  a  corner as it somehow snuck between 3 YCAC bodies at the near post. This week, though, the 2 goals  sandwiched a Joe Takeda penalty, 
				1-2, and YCAC were  still in the game. They were fortunate to stay within striking distance, however; saved by the post once and some good goalkeeping from Derrick Bean.  The stage was set though for Graemes late heroics and YCAC 
				were relieved to chalk up their 1st vicory of the season.<BR>
				At least 2 more chances for Maritizio to reverse the result as the 2 teams are drawn with each other in the Cup.<BR>

				<b class=blue>CLASH COUNTER JETS!</b>
				<BR>The Wall Street Clash got their first win of the season when they met Saitama Jets on the astroturf at Oi sunday evening. The first half was a tight affair in which the Clash took the lead when centre back Ian Webster's long 
				shot looped up into the air and was chested down for Phil Stroud to volley into the bottom right corner. The JETS were having a lot of the ball and just before half time they broke through to equalise, their striker putting it past 
				the exposed Clash keeper. The second half saw the JETS come out strong and had plenty of chances including one-on-ones, but the Clash keeper made a number of superb point blank stops. On a counter the Clash hit back, as Chris 
				Waters' through ball from halfway was met by Phil Stroud who calmly rounded the keeper and tucked it home. The Clash were holding on for a while, but were delighted to see the JETS centre back head back under pressure past his 
				keeper and Waters scored from a few yards out. A morale boosting victory for the Clash who had a far smaller squad but worked hard all night.<BR>

				<BR>Sunday morning saw Sala and Jetro cleanly perform another TML match on what must be the best surface that has been made available to any team so far in either league.(Mitsubishi Ground near Chofu). Before the game both sides were in jovial form, both looking forward to enjoying the beautiful pitch. Thats exactly what Sala did. While getting used to the traction that the surface provided Sala striker Brian Gallagher managed to jar his ankle with his overly flashy new boots. Subbing himself off for a change of boots gave enough time for striker Giles Legg to catch the end of a nice cross for a diving header to score the first. Half time 1-0.<BR>

Another came and went but the third chance he took for his first Sala goal. With a good height advantage over the rather short Jetro team and some controlled passing and tencacious play Sala managed to keep steady pressure on Jetro creating chance after chance for the Tsudanuma team. Headers from defenders Martin Arballo and Paul Clarke gave Sala a further 2 goals, and a nice curling shot from Stephen Brooke-Smith from open play made the score 5-0.<br>
						Jetro had some breaks from play but didn't really have more than a few shots on goal. They did have many free-kicks from around 20 yards out after some very light tackles from the Sala defenders. Perhaps just the difference in size between the 2 teams made tackles appear different but Sala defenders did play strongly and cleanly explaining the lack of cards from both teams. Sala MOTM Yoshiki Endo. For concentration, tenacity and clever passing skills.<br>

						In a fairly lopsided game, the Celts continued their good form with a comfortable win over the AFC Wanderers. Dominating from the start, the Celts went ahead after 3 minutes from a corner, no.5 losing his marker and slotting the ball home. The Celts further increased their lead 10 minutes later and with the score at 2-0 were rarely troubled by the Wanderers. After constant pressure, the Celts got their 3rd of the game thanks to a mix up between the Wanderers Centre-half and 'keeper. 3-0 at halftime.<br>
						The second half continued to see the Celts dominance but were unable to break down AFC who looked a lot determined in the second 40. AFC rarely threatened but seemed to have woken up from the first half beating. With a fairly uneventful second half, the Wanderers got one back from an excellent 25 yard free kick by Raph Collela.<br>
						3-1 and a justified scoreline.<br>

						Nova FC notched up their second win in a row and at the same time handed the Dutch Embassy their first loss of the season. The game was played on the massive Oi Futo pitch and its myriad of sidelines was a test for all involved.<br>
						The game started with both teams having quite a few chances with no reward. Nova kept the pressure on with most of the early play being in the Dutch half. The game turned in a 5 minute stretch with Stu Anderson notching his fourth and fifth goals of the season. Both goals were slotted home with calm precision. Nova FC were feeling quite proud of their 2-0 lead at the end of the first half but the break ended up giving the momentum to the men in orange.<br>
						The second half saw the Dutch push forward relentlessly with the reward being a superb one man effort from near the half way line which left the Nova defense corps at a loss. With the 2 goal cushion being knocked to one the game became a more physical affair leaving skin from both sides on the hungry astro turf. Nova finally put the game away with Greg Hammond skillfully passing(?) the ball off the post to himself to slot in the final goal.<br>

					<p>It was perfect conditions for the match between France FC and the WS Geckoes Saturday afternoon at Hachioji Park. The game was played at an energetic pace right from the start and Geckoes had the run of play for the first 20 minutes partly due to their physical play which the French took exception to, as did the referee, who, gaining control early and doing expertly well for the entire game, produced two early bookings to the Geckoes. As the French began to get a grip on proceedings they won a corner which resulted in outstanding goal. The Gekoes may have been guilty of ball watching as the ball was nodded towards the back post for Nicolas Bozzi to acrobatically volley the ball past goalkeeper Rob Keyworth who got a fingertip to the ball which not nearly enough to keep the powerful strike from flying into the upper corner. The half ended with Geckoes pressing for an equalizer and the French were solid in defense, though a good cross from the right produced a good headed chance for Simon Hiscocks, met well but straight at the keeper. The Geckoes continued to press in the second half and the equalizer arrived when the French failed to deal with a Gary Stout throw-in, Hiscocks once a again got his head to the ball and flicked on into the box, the ball feel kindly to Peter Zollar who made no mistake from a few yards out. After that the game continued to be physical to the end, producing another strong challenge from Spencer Reynolds deemed late and thus produced a second yellow and he was off, however, Pablo Gularte retaliated by pushing Reynolds and he had to go as well. The French had a couple of chances to snatch the game but for some fine goalkeeping from Rob, one effort blazed just wide of the post, and two super tackles, one by Greg Adams and one from the Geckoes influential skipper Simon Jelfs, kept the game at 1-1 which was probably a fair result.<br>

						A battling display from the WS Geckoes earned them a point on Saturday at Hachioji Park against France FC. Nicolas Bozzi opened the scoring for France FC with a stunning volley from the edge of the penalty box but this was cancelled out halfway through the second half when the Geckoes striker clinically finished from close range. In a fierce game, the inevitable red card was shown to the central midfielders from both sides. The reaction of the players at the end of the game told the story with the Geckoes elated and the France boys disappointed with the final 1-1 scoreline.<br>

A Hibs own goal against the run of play from a corner saw the Embassy up 1-0 at half time.

The Hibs then pressed foward and evened it up at 2-2 then sealed an improbable win with another Narama special. Final score: HIBS 3 BEFC 2<br>

				A clinically taken PJ Park hat trick and a rare Phil Denham goal had put YCAC well in command early in the 2nd half. Failure to turn dominant possession into further goals, though, left the door slightly ajar 
				for Jetro. They took advantage of a tiring home side to get their 2 late goals, the equalizer with just about the last kick of the match. What are the odds on Jetro drawing 4-4 2 weeks in a row and was the YCAC
