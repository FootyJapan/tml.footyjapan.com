						<b class=red>BARBARIANS UPSET JETS, FINISH LEAGUE ON A HIGH.</b><br>
						Barbarians came back from being a goal down to Saitama JETS at Ina on Saturday afternoon, recording a 2-1 win, their first of the season. It was a tale of 2 goalkeepers really, Barbarians had one, whereas JETs didn't, failing to hold on to their 1st half lead, conceding 2 goals to the 10 man opposition in the 2nd half. It's too little, too late for Barbarians as far as the league is concerned, but will have them in good confidence for the FJ Cup where they are in the tough group C with the likes of HIbs.<br>

					<p><b class=Or>WIND ASSISTED...OR NOT, CELTS HELD BY NOVA</b><br>
						When the wind blows at Shigaku, it's usually straight down the pitch and strong giving the ability to punt the length of the pitch almost. That's how it was for the Sunday evening meeting of Kanto Celts &amp; Nova FC but whether it assisted either team could be debated as both goals in the 1-1 draw were scored against the wind. Celts took the lead early in the 1st half after some good build up play on the right flank. A nice through ball from midfield was just poked through the advancing keepers legs to make it 1-0. Celts were the better of the 2 teams but the wind assisted clearances from the Nova defence led to some quick counter-attacks.<br>
						The 2nd half saw Nova struggling against both Celts and wind to get out of their half. They were under the kosh for long periods and were thankful to some wild shooting that they didn't go further down. It was thanks to an inspired substitution by Nova captain Daniel Bard, that Nova got their equalizer. When Nova got a corner, he changed all his substitutes at once, bringing on all the big guys who'd been keeping warm out of the wind. As planned, the high corner was met by a melee of players including the keeper and somehow ended up in the back of the net (along with said keeper). The ref had seen no foul though, so the goal stood and despite continual pressure from Celts there on, the score remained the same. Both teams have one game remaining.</P></p>

				<P><b>April 17th, Ina, Saitama. France finish with win</B><BR>
				An early start in far off Saitama saw the final match of the season for France &amp; Nelson, deciding which Division Nelson would be playing in from September. They obviously wanted Div 1 by the way they fought in the 1st half, but poor 
				finishing let them down. France went ahead after about 20 mins and held on till the break. In the 2nd half French defender Yannick Bethegnies pounced on a loose ball in the Nelson box after a lot of confusion, firing it in 
				to make it 2-0. A 3rd from Yoshikoshi put the game out of reach for Nelson but they did get a consolation goal near the end. They'll have to work on their finishing next season to try to get back up to Division 1!<BR>
				<B class=green>DUTCH OVERPOWER JETS</B><BR>
				In the other match of the day, Dutch Embassy team reclaimed 2nd spot in Division 2 with a 3-2 win over Saitama JETS. The Dutch stormed into a 3-0 lead, but the JETS fought their way back to 3-2 and had it not been for 
				some great goal keeping could easily have equalized. So it goes down to the final game for Dutch and Geckoes to see who'll be promoted to Div 1 next season.</P>

				<P><b>April 11th, YC&amp;AC. Whatever happens, Hibernian can say they finished the first season of TML on top of Division 1</B> on points, but whether they can win outright remains in the hands of the Swiss!<BR>
				It was a thrilling encounter on a warm spring day, facing league top scorer Graeme Lane &amp; his YC&amp;AC team on their home ground, Hibs put in a solid performance and were worthy of their 1-0 victory.<BR>
				The first half was very even, both teams playing the ball around well in mid-field but the defences holding strong and not letting much through. The Hibs applied the pressure in the second half though and the YC&amp;AC defence was 
				kept busy. Bevan Colless fired over from close range and Mick O'Hagen had a long range effort clip the bar. At the other end, Joe Takeda broke through only to fire the ball into orbit.<BR>
				The break came when Yasu Yomota beat his man on the left, cut into the box and drove in his shot at the near post leaving the keeper little hope. YC&amp;AC tried to fight back and looked to have a chance when Lane broke through 
				the Hibs defence. It was the leagues top striker vs the top Keeper, Hitoshi Ono, who'd only let in 2 goals in his 6 previous matches. Both racing to meet the ball just inside the 18 yd box, Lane just got a toe to it first, but 
				the experienced keeper spread himself well blocking both ball &amp; player. That was the last real threat from YC&amp;AC and Hibs were jubilant at the sound of the final whistle. They now have a long month to wait until they find 
				out the final outcome of who are Champions. <BR><A HREF="http://www.tokyohibs.com/index_files/Page1116.htm" target=_blank>more from Hibs...</A><BR>

				<P><b>April 10th, YC&amp;AC. BFC ended their TML campaign on a winning note,</B> striker Jon Day scoring twice in a 2-1 victory over France FC.<BR>
				Things looked set for disaster as the ref got caught in traffic jams &amp; the game had to be started using stand-ins from each team, the French officiating the first 20 mins &amp; BFC till the ref arrived at half-time. 
				This didn't seem to effect the play though and Day scored with a sweetly struck free-kick into the top left corner after 
				10 minutes, french goalie Elliot having decided to catch the ball outside the area right in front of goal. France almost equalized soon after as Gilles Soulie was put through on goal and calmly slotted home, 
				but the French linesman gave offside. The French pushed hard in the 
				2nd half mounting increasing attacks but BFC counter-attacked and Day got his second with 15 minutes remaining to give BFC a cushion in an absorbing contest. The French pulled one back with almost the last kick of the game, but overall 
				BFC just about deserved the points. It's now up to Sala in their final match, as to whether it's them or BFC who'll get 4th place in the league.

				In the proverbial 'game of two halves', Geckoes dominated from the start against Nova FC and took a commanding 4-0 lead in the 1st half on the small pitch at Hachioji 
				Park. Nova didn't let this kill them off however and came out looking for blood in the 2nd half. It was they that dominated, playing much better football pulling 2 goals 
				back and had it not been some stout defending, could have been more. Angelo silenced Nova though by scoring his 2nd of the afternoon and putting the game out 
				of reach at 5-2. So the pressure is on the Dutch now to catch Geckoes.<A HREF="http://www.wsgeckoes.net/" target=_blank>more from geckoes...</A></P>

				Two 1st half penalties and a 2nd half sending off were the main features of this battle between Geckoes &amp; JETs luckily spared the rain that cancelled fixtures on other 
				grounds. All the goals came in the 1st half, Jonathan Rodriguez picking up both a goal and yellow card for Geckoes.  A 2nd yellow after 50 minutes meant he was only the 
				2nd player to be sent off in the league. Despite being down to 10 men though, Geckoes held on for the win meaning they are only a point behind 2nd placed Dutch, both with

					<p><b class=blue>AU REVOIR CAPITAINE!</b>French bid farewell to Faycal with a win.<br>
						France FC are losing their charismatic captain, Faycal, who is off to Australia after 7 years in Japan and what better way to see him off than with a win. In Maritizio's last game of the season, they couldn't repeat the form from last week that gave them a win over Jetro. The French dominated the midfield, soon taking the lead. At 3-0 in the 2nd half, the French briefly let their guard down and quick thinking Kuni Hosoi got a goal back with a cheeky lob. It was to be a 2nd win for the French though with a 4th gaol sealing the victory, so Maritizio must wait for the result between France &amp; Nelson to see if they'll be playing 1st division football in September.<br>
						<b>Jetro hold Sala to goalless draw</b> In the final fixture of the day, Sala and Jetro played out a 0-0 draw as it got windier &amp; colder at Shin Koiwa. There were few chances at either end with the result being a fair reflection of the match. A major controversy was averted right at the end, as the floodlights were dimmed as Jetro were about to take a free kick from just outside the area. The ref allowed the kick to be taken before blowing the final whistle amid cries of &quot;Ref, I can't see a bloody thing!&quot; The kick missed, but had it gone in.....<br>

Evans scored twice -- both headers as BFC dominated from the start, playing some excellent one-touch football on the astroturf pitch. Jon, Alastair, Paul and man of the match Neil also got on the score sheet to give BFC a welcome confidence boost after a poor run of results. Their final match is against France FC next week, while Nelson too must face France in their final game, needing a win to avoid relegation to Div 2 next season. <a href="javascript:popwindow('http://www.bfctokyo.com/archive/reports/2004/021.html','top=10,left=10,width=550,height=450,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more from BFC...</a></p>
