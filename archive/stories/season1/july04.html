Newly promoted 
				Perfidious Albion may well have had the psychological edge from the kick-off, following a string of bad results from the Swiss in the run-up to the final and the latter half of the TML.<BR><BR>
				In temperatures soaring well into the 30's, it was the Swiss who found the back of the net first as they broke from defense and moved the ball swiftly through midfield. Dave Pratt's quick feet and pin-point shot left the Albion 
				keeper with too much to do and put The Swiss one nil up just before the well earned half time break.<BR><BR>
				Perfidious Albion's half time talk seemed to be taking effect early in the second half as some tenacious breaks through midfield started to exploit some lackluster  (heat exhausted) tracking back from the Swiss. The Swiss quickly 
				switched back into "Swiss" mode and tightened things up and "Nuddy" the Swiss's surrogate Peruvian/Japanese superstar had the Albion midfield at 6's and 7's.  Seeing the keeper well off his line "Nuddy" cheekily lobbed the Albion 
				No.1 from 40 yards, sparing him no blushes, 2-0.<BR><BR>
				Ten minutes from time and a moment of controversy saw a red card drawn for what the referee insists was a clear case of hand-ball by a Swiss defender on the goal line. The penalty was nicely slotted away instilling a glimmer of 
				hope for the Albion as the Swiss were now down to ten men. A frantic final 5 minutes saw chances at both ends but at the final whistle the score remained 2-1 and the Swiss walked away with the inaugural Footy Japan Cup and their 
				acclaimed reputation intact. Perfidious Albion, however, will clearly be pulling no punches when it comes to the TML division-one title chase next season - definitely a team to watch out for.<BR>

				</table><P><b>July 25th Oi Futo. A gutsy performance by Shane</b> wasn't quite enough for the 2nd Division outfit to repeat their Hibs giant-killing heroics against a typically efficient and solid Swiss Kickers, who 
				secured a place in the final with a second-half goal from Karl Hahne.<BR><BR>
				Both teams started brightly, with Swiss trying to get it down and short-pass their way into the last third, and Shane defending well and looking to launch quick counterattacks.  Well, it worked for Greece!  
				Eventually, despite the Herculean efforts of Shane's Gary Robinson, the Swiss started to take control of the middle of the park.  The new Swiss midfielder, drafted in to replace missing regulars,  was outstanding, 
				constantly getting away from his man and laying the ball off intelligently.  But Shane were working hard to get men behind the ball and when Swiss did break through, they found Shane keeper Muro, in superb form, with 
				a string of flying saves and brave one-on-one blocks.  When he was finally beaten, Shane showed they had luck with them too, as the ball came off the inside of the post and bounced along the goal-line without going in.<BR><BR>
				The second half brought more of the same, with the Swiss in the box seat but Shane defending like men possessed and doing just enough up front to keep hopes of an upset alive. 25 minutes in, though, Swiss pressure told. 
				Another nice passing move up the middle set up Jurg for a fierce shot which crashed against the foot of the post.  This time the rebound fell more kindly for Swiss,  straight to the right boot of Karl Hahne who tucked it 
				away first time. The goal visibly deflated Shane, who were starting to wilt in the heat, and Swiss played out the match without too many scares.<BR><BR>
				So, Swiss's shock defeat against Geckoes didn't in the end impede their progress to yet another final, which as usual they will start as favourites. But if Shane's cup form is anything to go by, look for them to terrorize the 
				2nd Division next season.<BR>

					<p>A very even battle between Perfidious Albion (a.k.a. British Embassy) and France FC was decided by a defensive slip, when one of the French defenders deflected the ball in his own net mid way through the 2nd half.<br>
						Both teams turned up with plenty of substitutes, having learned lessons from the previous weeks matches in 'sauna like' conditions, and this showed in the way the pressure was kept up by both teams from start to finish.<br>
						Chances were at a premium throughout the game, as neither the trickery of Naoki Saito of France or 'Hitman' Fernando for BEFC could break down the opposition defence. Rob Flynn, the BEFC centre back was his usual commanding self, clearing everything in the air, as did Francois Mallet, the French captain, at the other end.<br>
						As they moved into the 2nd half, it looked like it may be a stalemate, both teams making regular substitutions to keep fresh legs, but neither team making the breakthrough. 10 minutes from time though, a Perfidious attack led by 'Wooly' &amp; Sami Benlassoud led to a fired in ball being deflected by an unlucky defender past his own keeper.<br>
						Simon Woolhouse urged his British side on, as the French tried to counter winning numerous corners in the remaining minutes. Stout defending &amp; good goalkeeping kept the french out however and Perfidious Albion found themselves in the same position as Millwall, being a 2nd Division team in the Cup Final.</p>

				were able to pull a goal out of nothing with Jurgen's quick footwork in the box and powerful finish going past the Shane keeper. <BR>1-0.  
				Shane didn't give up hope and continued to play well, with good runs down the wings and a more good passing moves. <BR>

						Now Shane were really up for it. Their Central defender, Dave Callaghan was getting everybody pumped up. Hibs were suddenly on the ropes and then just a few minutes after finding themselves at 1-1, they were 2-1 down.<br>
						This time, another brilliant cross from a free kick found the Shane Strikers head and he looped the ball over the goalkeeper and sweetly into the net.<br>
						Hibs tried to get back into the game with a few long shots but to no avail. At half time it was 2-1 to Shane.<br>
						<br>
						The second half opened very brightly for Hibs. They had many corners and had Shane under pressure for a short spell in the game. One hibs player jinked thru&nbsp;3 defenders and his shot was just wide of the post. Shane were still a threat on the counter attack and almost took a 3-1 lead only to be denied by fantastic goalkeeping from the Hibs keeper, hitoshi Ono.<br>
						Hibs pushed and pushed for an equaliser only to see every attack break down due to a very organized Shane backline. There were scenes of celebration for the Shane players at the final whistle in what was a very good game and Shane&nbsp;had themselves a well deserved victory.<br>

				</table><P>July 17th Oi Futo. In an eventful game on the dirt pitch at Oi, France, playing in white, outlasted a valiant effort by the Geckoes, playing in the blue of the national French team! The 
				first half started with a bang as the French took a first minute lead with a beautifully chipped ball from the edge of the area by Etsushi Yoshikoshi who looked dangerous throughout the game, this 
				was to be his only real scoring chance though and he took full advantage. <BR><BR>
				The momentum was with the French and they went close on two or three subsequent moves. The Geckoes however did not seem to mind too much, they regrouped and were soon playing well-organized, team 
				football, and probably had the edge on possession in the half. Their inability to penetrate the solid back four of the French however saw them frustrated, and the game threatened to kick off in 
				another sense when things were brought to a fever pitch by a controversial penalty decision that went Geckoes way. <BR>
				1-1 and with the first-half seconds running out a ball lobbed into the Geckoes area found the French number 9 colliding with the Geckoes keeper. Rob the Geckoes keeper decided that the view from the 
				six yard  box was rather nice and steadfastly refused to move until an ambulance was called and 7 men with a stretcher were allowed to carry him off for X-rays and other niceties. <BR>

					<p>Get well soon Rob.<br>
						<br>
						After a break of 25 minutes for said excitements the second half got under way and it was all the French could do to contain the Geckoes in a furious onslaught that lasted 15 or 20 minutes, but contain them they did, and the tide really turned when the French got a corner against the run of play which was, again, beautifully finished by a stout Gallic figure storming through the blue defense.<br>
						<br>
						From then on frustration and tiredness began to take their toll on the gallant Geckoes, and the French wrapped things up with the piece-de-resistance in the final ten minutes; another, BEAUTIFUL shot, this time from their number 8, Ludovic Michuszewski who ran onto a ball played through the stranded defenders (by the best player on the pitch, the French midfield play-maker Kazu, No 10) and dispatched it with suave aplomb into the top corner.<br>
						<br>
						The result was unfair to the Geckoes because theirs was the better team performance, what they lacked though was some of that Gallic flair and beauty found in easy abundance by their opponents. Despite the other French midfielders playing very much an individual style of football, Kazu was enough of an influence to make the difference, if they are to go on in the competition though they will have to find something else to rely on apart from that panache, and with a team with more creative options they may find themselves in trouble.<br>

				Geckoes' Manager Rob Keyworth's warning, "Sid, you're gonna eat those words!" came back to haunt the TML premiere.<BR><BR>
				The Swiss took the lead mid-way through the 1st half, when a defensive error left Angelo free in the 6 yard box to score. The new look Geckoes wearing blue, rather than their usual yellow strip, battled back hard, 
				taking advantage of a fatigued looking Swiss midfield who were flagging in the heat. They were rewarded when Mikkel Troen neatly rounded Okubo, the Swiss' stand-in keeper, to make it 1-1.<BR>
				They were then unlucky not to be leading by the break, as they saw another shot come off the woodwork, but it remained 1-1 at half-time.<BR><BR>
				The 2nd half saw both teams suffering in the oppressive heat &amp; humidity, the Swiss strikers usually so deadly, not finding their mark. As the game wore on it seemed as though a draw was on the cards,
