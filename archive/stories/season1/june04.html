				</table><P>June 26th Oi Futo. 2nd spot in Group B was wide open as the final games were played simultaniously at 2 locations. Div 1 Champions Hibernian FC, met newly promoted Div 2 Champs, Perfidious Albion at OiFuto, while zillions of miles away at Ina, Saitama, BFC
				Vagabonds played Barbarians. With both Albion &amp; Barbarians on 3 points, it looked like Barbarians may only need a draw with Hibs being favourite in the group.<BR><BR>
				So it was thinking they'd need a result to have any chance, that Simon, Collier &amp; Biffa led their squad out to meet the peril of Terry Cooney &amp; the Hibs.<BR>
				It was a tough battle from the word go, with Hibs midfield working hard to take control. Albion keeper Giles Lever was froced to make to smart saves to keep out Dave Thomas &amp; keita Narama, but was unable to keep out the latter when he
				was put though midway through the 1st half. Narama was quick to chase down a ball angled into the right side of the box, getting there in time to slide it under the advancing keeper.<BR>
				Just before half-time, Bevan Colless latched onto a ball hoisted over the defence and perfectly lobbed the stranded keeper. The Albion linesman frantically flagged for offside but the ref deemed it not to be interfering with play and the goal stood.<BR><BR>

					<p>2-0 at the break and things looked grim for Albion. Despite pleas to make phonecalls, no news could be obtained rom the other match, so Albion went back out fighting. Gerard Brady working well down the right, with Fernando &amp; Sami in te centre, started to give Hibs a few problems but on the counter Yasu Yomoto hit the bar and Ike Nakayama terrorized the Albion defence.<br>
						In the final quarter of the match, Albion got the break-through they were looking for as Fernando Bermudez slipped past the Hibs defenders and stroked the ball under Hitoshi Ono to make it 2-1 but they couldn't find the 2nd they needed.<br>
						When the final whistle went, Albion thought they'd blown it. It wasn't until 15 minute later that a call came through from Ina, saying Vagabonds had beaten Barbarians 3-2, thus giving Albion 2nd place in the group with a +4 goal difference.<br>
						Hibernian will now face Shane FC and Albion meet BFC in the quarter finals on July 18th.<br>
						<br>
						<b class=red>JETS GET 1st WIN</b><br>
						The Saitama Jets got their first win in the Footy Japan Cup, with a convincing 5-0 win over struggling Hachioji Wanderers.<br>
						The Jets raced to a 3-0 lead at half-time with goals from Garner, Gildart and Eite, and added 2 more for good measure in the second period.<br>
						A string of near-misses from Saitama in the second-half, including one effort which rattled the Hachioji crossbar, meant that the eventual 5-0 scoreline was flattering to the Wanderers, who ended their cup campaign without a goal. Lets hope they get some practice in the Summer ready for Division 2 next season, good luck!</p>

				the last 10 minutes as both teams flagged in the heat. Again in quick succession, the french scored 2 goals 8 &amp; 6 minutes from time. With a 4 goal advantage, everything was going their way, till Nova took advantage of some
				sloppy defending and scored 2 in the last 2 minutes. It was too little too late though so it's now up to Sala vs Nova to see who tops the group!<BR><BR>
				In the 2nd match, Shane FC took an early lead through James Knight and it was enough to give them the game. They held onto the 1-0 lead in the searing heat to join Turtle FC on 6 points but lower on goal difference. A draw with
				Rikimaru in their final game will be enough to see Shane into the 1/4 finals.<BR>

				BFC overcame searing heat and cyclonic dust-storms to beat Rikimaru FC 4-0 and book their place in the knockout stages of the Footy Japan Cup on Sunday. A first-half double from Alastair Himmer and further goals
				after the break from young Andy Dunn and Evans made it three out of three for BFC in the cup following a disappointing league campaign. The margin of victory could have been greater but  BFC were happy to escape with another victory

				goal (albeit an unlucky own goal) after just 11 minutes. Taking the play to the opposition, they made it 2-0 through Katamata after 25 minutes and seemed well in control of the game. Sala, coming off the back of a
				tournament win in Nagano, realized they needed to dig in and fight to get a result. That's just what striker Roody Charles did, firing home 2 goals in quick succession before half-time<BR>
				After the break, Sala were the more dominant taking the lead through Naoki Ogasawara after 10 minutes. It stayed like that until 15 minutes from the end when Maritizio were handed a lifeline, a Penalty nicely converted, that could
				give them a valuable 4th point in their group. With just 5 minutes to go however kentaro Ishii struck the winning goal for Sala, putting them back at the top of the group with France FC, both on 4 points.<BR>

				Swiss Kickers &amp; WallStreet Geckoes, both secured qualification to the 1/4 Finals of the FJ Cup with their 2nd wins in group C.<BR>

				In the 2nd match at Ina, Wallstreet Geckoes beat Hachioji Wanderers 3-0 to send them off packing along with the JETs. The match between Swiss &amp; Geckoes to decide who is 1st &amp; 2nd, is to be re-arranged in the next couple
				of weeks (having been cancelled last week due to rain).</P>

It was therefore decided by Brian, the award go to the team with the most goals of the 2, which was BFC with 16. There were many expressions of surprise at BFC being awarded this as they're not famous for their good behaviour, but it's more a testament to the good refereeing. Brian graciously accepted the award, though was embarrassed to admit, it was he who picked up BFC's only card but promised to be a good lad next season!.<br>
