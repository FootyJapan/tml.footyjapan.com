Newly promoted
				Perfidious Albion may well have had the psychological edge from the kick-off, following a string of bad results from the Swiss in the run-up to the final and the latter half of the TML.<BR><BR>
				In temperatures soaring well into the 30's, it was the Swiss who found the back of the net first as they broke from defense and moved the ball swiftly through midfield. Dave Pratt's quick feet and pin-point shot left the Albion
				keeper with too much to do and put The Swiss one nil up just before the well earned half time break.<BR><BR>
				Perfidious Albion's half time talk seemed to be taking effect early in the second half as some tenacious breaks through midfield started to exploit some lackluster  (heat exhausted) tracking back from the Swiss. The Swiss quickly
				switched back into "Swiss" mode and tightened things up and "Nuddy" the Swiss's surrogate Peruvian/Japanese superstar had the Albion midfield at 6's and 7's.  Seeing the keeper well off his line "Nuddy" cheekily lobbed the Albion
				No.1 from 40 yards, sparing him no blushes, 2-0.<BR><BR>
				Ten minutes from time and a moment of controversy saw a red card drawn for what the referee insists was a clear case of hand-ball by a Swiss defender on the goal line. The penalty was nicely slotted away instilling a glimmer of
				hope for the Albion as the Swiss were now down to ten men. A frantic final 5 minutes saw chances at both ends but at the final whistle the score remained 2-1 and the Swiss walked away with the inaugural Footy Japan Cup and their
				acclaimed reputation intact. Perfidious Albion, however, will clearly be pulling no punches when it comes to the TML division-one title chase next season - definitely a team to watch out for.<BR>

				</table><P><b>July 25th Oi Futo. A gutsy performance by Shane</b> wasn't quite enough for the 2nd Division outfit to repeat their Hibs giant-killing heroics against a typically efficient and solid Swiss Kickers, who
				secured a place in the final with a second-half goal from Karl Hahne.<BR><BR>
				Both teams started brightly, with Swiss trying to get it down and short-pass their way into the last third, and Shane defending well and looking to launch quick counterattacks.  Well, it worked for Greece!
				Eventually, despite the Herculean efforts of Shane's Gary Robinson, the Swiss started to take control of the middle of the park.  The new Swiss midfielder, drafted in to replace missing regulars,  was outstanding,
				constantly getting away from his man and laying the ball off intelligently.  But Shane were working hard to get men behind the ball and when Swiss did break through, they found Shane keeper Muro, in superb form, with
				a string of flying saves and brave one-on-one blocks.  When he was finally beaten, Shane showed they had luck with them too, as the ball came off the inside of the post and bounced along the goal-line without going in.<BR><BR>
				The second half brought more of the same, with the Swiss in the box seat but Shane defending like men possessed and doing just enough up front to keep hopes of an upset alive. 25 minutes in, though, Swiss pressure told.
				Another nice passing move up the middle set up Jurg for a fierce shot which crashed against the foot of the post.  This time the rebound fell more kindly for Swiss,  straight to the right boot of Karl Hahne who tucked it
				away first time. The goal visibly deflated Shane, who were starting to wilt in the heat, and Swiss played out the match without too many scares.<BR><BR>
				So, Swiss's shock defeat against Geckoes didn't in the end impede their progress to yet another final, which as usual they will start as favourites. But if Shane's cup form is anything to go by, look for them to terrorize the
				2nd Division next season.<BR>

					<p>A very even battle between Perfidious Albion (a.k.a. British Embassy) and France FC was decided by a defensive slip, when one of the French defenders deflected the ball in his own net mid way through the 2nd half.<br>
						Both teams turned up with plenty of substitutes, having learned lessons from the previous weeks matches in 'sauna like' conditions, and this showed in the way the pressure was kept up by both teams from start to finish.<br>
						Chances were at a premium throughout the game, as neither the trickery of Naoki Saito of France or 'Hitman' Fernando for BEFC could break down the opposition defence. Rob Flynn, the BEFC centre back was his usual commanding self, clearing everything in the air, as did Francois Mallet, the French captain, at the other end.<br>
						As they moved into the 2nd half, it looked like it may be a stalemate, both teams making regular substitutions to keep fresh legs, but neither team making the breakthrough. 10 minutes from time though, a Perfidious attack led by 'Wooly' &amp; Sami Benlassoud led to a fired in ball being deflected by an unlucky defender past his own keeper.<br>
						Simon Woolhouse urged his British side on, as the French tried to counter winning numerous corners in the remaining minutes. Stout defending &amp; good goalkeeping kept the french out however and Perfidious Albion found themselves in the same position as Millwall, being a 2nd Division team in the Cup Final.</p>

						Hibs tried to get back into the game with a few long shots but to no avail. At half time it was 2-1 to Shane.<br>

						The second half opened very brightly for Hibs. They had many corners and had Shane under pressure for a short spell in the game. One hibs player jinked thru&nbsp;3 defenders and his shot was just wide of the post. Shane were still a threat on the counter attack and almost took a 3-1 lead only to be denied by fantastic goalkeeping from the Hibs keeper, hitoshi Ono.<br>
						Hibs pushed and pushed for an equaliser only to see every attack break down due to a very organized Shane backline. There were scenes of celebration for the Shane players at the final whistle in what was a very good game and Shane&nbsp;had themselves a well deserved victory.<br>

				</table><P>July 17th Oi Futo. In an eventful game on the dirt pitch at Oi, France, playing in white, outlasted a valiant effort by the Geckoes, playing in the blue of the national French team! The
				first half started with a bang as the French took a first minute lead with a beautifully chipped ball from the edge of the area by Etsushi Yoshikoshi who looked dangerous throughout the game, this
				was to be his only real scoring chance though and he took full advantage. <BR><BR>
				The momentum was with the French and they went close on two or three subsequent moves. The Geckoes however did not seem to mind too much, they regrouped and were soon playing well-organized, team
				football, and probably had the edge on possession in the half. Their inability to penetrate the solid back four of the French however saw them frustrated, and the game threatened to kick off in
				another sense when things were brought to a fever pitch by a controversial penalty decision that went Geckoes way. <BR>
				1-1 and with the first-half seconds running out a ball lobbed into the Geckoes area found the French number 9 colliding with the Geckoes keeper. Rob the Geckoes keeper decided that the view from the
				six yard  box was rather nice and steadfastly refused to move until an ambulance was called and 7 men with a stretcher were allowed to carry him off for X-rays and other niceties. <BR>

					<p>Get well soon Rob.<br>
						<br>
						After a break of 25 minutes for said excitements the second half got under way and it was all the French could do to contain the Geckoes in a furious onslaught that lasted 15 or 20 minutes, but contain them they did, and the tide really turned when the French got a corner against the run of play which was, again, beautifully finished by a stout Gallic figure storming through the blue defense.<br>
						<br>
						From then on frustration and tiredness began to take their toll on the gallant Geckoes, and the French wrapped things up with the piece-de-resistance in the final ten minutes; another, BEAUTIFUL shot, this time from their number 8, Ludovic Michuszewski who ran onto a ball played through the stranded defenders (by the best player on the pitch, the French midfield play-maker Kazu, No 10) and dispatched it with suave aplomb into the top corner.<br>
						<br>
						The result was unfair to the Geckoes because theirs was the better team performance, what they lacked though was some of that Gallic flair and beauty found in easy abundance by their opponents. Despite the other French midfielders playing very much an individual style of football, Kazu was enough of an influence to make the difference, if they are to go on in the competition though they will have to find something else to rely on apart from that panache, and with a team with more creative options they may find themselves in trouble.<br>

				Geckoes' Manager Rob Keyworth's warning, "Sid, you're gonna eat those words!" came back to haunt the TML premiere.<BR><BR>
				The Swiss took the lead mid-way through the 1st half, when a defensive error left Angelo free in the 6 yard box to score. The new look Geckoes wearing blue, rather than their usual yellow strip, battled back hard,
				taking advantage of a fatigued looking Swiss midfield who were flagging in the heat. They were rewarded when Mikkel Troen neatly rounded Okubo, the Swiss' stand-in keeper, to make it 1-1.<BR>
				They were then unlucky not to be leading by the break, as they saw another shot come off the woodwork, but it remained 1-1 at half-time.<BR><BR>
				The 2nd half saw both teams suffering in the oppressive heat &amp; humidity, the Swiss strikers usually so deadly, not finding their mark. As the game wore on it seemed as though a draw was on the cards,
				but as in recent weeks the final period saw a flurry of goals, all at the Swiss end.<BR>

					<p>2-0 at the break and things looked grim for Albion. Despite pleas to make phonecalls, no news could be obtained rom the other match, so Albion went back out fighting. Gerard Brady working well down the right, with Fernando &amp; Sami in te centre, started to give Hibs a few problems but on the counter Yasu Yomoto hit the bar and Ike Nakayama terrorized the Albion defence.<br>
						In the final quarter of the match, Albion got the break-through they were looking for as Fernando Bermudez slipped past the Hibs defenders and stroked the ball under Hitoshi Ono to make it 2-1 but they couldn't find the 2nd they needed.<br>
						When the final whistle went, Albion thought they'd blown it. It wasn't until 15 minute later that a call came through from Ina, saying Vagabonds had beaten Barbarians 3-2, thus giving Albion 2nd place in the group with a +4 goal difference.<br>
						Hibernian will now face Shane FC and Albion meet BFC in the quarter finals on July 18th.<br>
						<br>
						<b class=red>JETS GET 1st WIN</b><br>
						The Saitama Jets got their first win in the Footy Japan Cup, with a convincing 5-0 win over struggling Hachioji Wanderers.<br>
						The Jets raced to a 3-0 lead at half-time with goals from Garner, Gildart and Eite, and added 2 more for good measure in the second period.<br>
						A string of near-misses from Saitama in the second-half, including one effort which rattled the Hachioji crossbar, meant that the eventual 5-0 scoreline was flattering to the Wanderers, who ended their cup campaign without a goal. Lets hope they get some practice in the Summer ready for Division 2 next season, good luck!</p>

Both 1st half scorers got 2nd goals along with Silvano and a rare headed goal for Keith Crowley.</p>

					<p>The first of the new teams joining TML, Hachioji Wanderers, got a rather rough introduction when they had to meet Swiss Kickers in their FJ Cup group C meeting. Swiss of course had a point to prove after their previous weeks debacle and made the Wanderers the focus of their frustration at having lost the league. Wanderers Captain Andy Watanabe was well aware of the Swiss' reputation and hoped by playing them first, using an 'eleven men behind the ball' strategy, they may have a chance to get something... Right!<br>
						Even with many players missing, Swiss still had a formidable squad. German striker, Karl Hahne, showed why he was runner up in the Div 1 Golden boot, scoring a hat-trick within a 12 minute period late in the 1st half, followed by another goal in the 2nd half.<br>
						Wanderers Finnish Keeper, Jyrki Jaaskelainen (Well that's what the team-sheet says, honest) had a very busy day in the office, making multiple saves yet still having to pick the ball out of the back of the net at regular intervals. The score could have been double but the Wanderers took it in their stride well, even cheekily asking after the game &quot;was it 1 or 2 nil?&quot;<br>

						I was surprised turning up to the first match of the day, between Top of Div 1 - Hibs &amp; bottom of Div 2 - Barbarians, to find the score was 0-0 and even more surprised to see it stay that way till half-time. Of course, with 2 teams so far apart in the league, you'd expect lots of goals, but there in lies the glory of the cup. The underdogs were fighting back - well more like holding on by the skin of their teeth!<br>
						Things turned bad for Barbarians as a ball into the box was obstructed by the trailing arm of a defender, giving the ref no choice but blow for a penalty. This was duly dispatched by Keita Narama and seemed to open the flood-gates.<br>
						Mick O'Hagen was on fine form, firing home a couple of great strikes and fellow 'Oldboy' George Clarkson was well pleased to watch not one, but two of his back post headers beat the keeper. The 5-0 end result was soured for the Hibs though, as defender Karl Twohig was stretchered(well carried) off with torn ligaments in his ankle and now looking at another long lay off.<br>

Rikimaru, who will join Turtle in Division 2 next season, fought a spirited match giving their rivals little space to move. The young Japanese team closed Turtle down at every opportunity, which led to their 2nd goal directly. A Turtle defender tried to clear the ball at the edge of his box, his kick only coming straight back off the Rikimaru strikers, 'thigh'?, looping over the keeper &amp; in. A tad lucky but an equalizer all the same.<br>
						Turtle were having none of it though, taking advantage of a defensive error, scored the winner 10 mins from time.<br>

						Even the late arrival of John Ologbosere, could only provide one goal for Maritizio in the 2nd half, leaving them the task ahead of beating Sala if they want to progress in the cup, whereas the French still have 2 to play.</p>

				In scenes more reminiscent of Victorian London's foggy back streets, Shane FC met Geckoes on a wet, misty evening in the wilds of Saitama's Hachioji Park. Even with heavy rain falling all day, there was no way the artificial ground

				completed with a nice cross. The ball should have been cleared, but somehow made it through to the back post leaving an easy tap in for Alex Crawshaw's first goal. 1-0.<BR>
				Alex got his 2nd mid way through the 2nd half when he superbly trapped a though ball about 25 yards out. He looked up, saw the keeper off his line and expertly chipped him for 2-0.<BR>
				Shane kept pushing to try and get back in the game, but were hit with a classic sucker punch when Geckoes caught them on the break and Chris Waters chipped the Keeper for No. 3. The scoreline flattered Geckoes somewhat, but they won't mind as

					<p><b class=Or>WIND ASSISTED...OR NOT, CELTS HELD BY NOVA</b><br>
						When the wind blows at Shigaku, it's usually straight down the pitch and strong giving the ability to punt the length of the pitch almost. That's how it was for the Sunday evening meeting of Kanto Celts &amp; Nova FC but whether it assisted either team could be debated as both goals in the 1-1 draw were scored against the wind. Celts took the lead early in the 1st half after some good build up play on the right flank. A nice through ball from midfield was just poked through the advancing keepers legs to make it 1-0. Celts were the better of the 2 teams but the wind assisted clearances from the Nova defence led to some quick counter-attacks.<br>
						The 2nd half saw Nova struggling against both Celts and wind to get out of their half. They were under the kosh for long periods and were thankful to some wild shooting that they didn't go further down. It was thanks to an inspired substitution by Nova captain Daniel Bard, that Nova got their equalizer. When Nova got a corner, he changed all his substitutes at once, bringing on all the big guys who'd been keeping warm out of the wind. As planned, the high corner was met by a melee of players including the keeper and somehow ended up in the back of the net (along with said keeper). The ref had seen no foul though, so the goal stood and despite continual pressure from Celts there on, the score remained the same. Both teams have one game remaining.</P>

				An early start in far off Saitama saw the final match of the season for France &amp; Nelson, deciding which Division Nelson would be playing in from September. They obviously wanted Div 1 by the way they fought in the 1st half, but poor
				finishing let them down. France went ahead after about 20 mins and held on till the break. In the 2nd half French defender Yannick Bethegnies pounced on a loose ball in the Nelson box after a lot of confusion, firing it in
				to make it 2-0. A 3rd from Yoshikoshi put the game out of reach for Nelson but they did get a consolation goal near the end. They'll have to work on their finishing next season to try to get back up to Division 1!<BR>
				<B class=green>DUTCH OVERPOWER JETS</B><BR>
				In the other match of the day, Dutch Embassy team reclaimed 2nd spot in Division 2 with a 3-2 win over Saitama JETS. The Dutch stormed into a 3-0 lead, but the JETS fought their way back to 3-2 and had it not been for
				some great goal keeping could easily have equalized. So it goes down to the final game for Dutch and Geckoes to see who'll be promoted to Div 1 next season.</P>

				<P><b>April 11th, YC&amp;AC. Whatever happens, Hibernian can say they finished the first season of TML on top of Division 1</B> on points, but whether they can win outright remains in the hands of the Swiss!<BR>
				It was a thrilling encounter on a warm spring day, facing league top scorer Graeme Lane &amp; his YC&amp;AC team on their home ground, Hibs put in a solid performance and were worthy of their 1-0 victory.<BR>
				The first half was very even, both teams playing the ball around well in mid-field but the defences holding strong and not letting much through. The Hibs applied the pressure in the second half though and the YC&amp;AC defence was
				kept busy. Bevan Colless fired over from close range and Mick O'Hagen had a long range effort clip the bar. At the other end, Joe Takeda broke through only to fire the ball into orbit.<BR>
				The break came when Yasu Yomota beat his man on the left, cut into the box and drove in his shot at the near post leaving the keeper little hope. YC&amp;AC tried to fight back and looked to have a chance when Lane broke through
				the Hibs defence. It was the leagues top striker vs the top Keeper, Hitoshi Ono, who'd only let in 2 goals in his 6 previous matches. Both racing to meet the ball just inside the 18 yd box, Lane just got a toe to it first, but
				the experienced keeper spread himself well blocking both ball &amp; player. That was the last real threat from YC&amp;AC and Hibs were jubilant at the sound of the final whistle. They now have a long month to wait until they find
				out the final outcome of who are Champions. <BR><A HREF="http://www.tokyohibs.com/index_files/Page1116.htm" target=_blank>more from Hibs...</A><BR>

						France FC are losing their charismatic captain, Faycal, who is off to Australia after 7 years in Japan and what better way to see him off than with a win. In Maritizio's last game of the season, they couldn't repeat the form from last week that gave them a win over Jetro. The French dominated the midfield, soon taking the lead. At 3-0 in the 2nd half, the French briefly let their guard down and quick thinking Kuni Hosoi got a goal back with a cheeky lob. It was to be a 2nd win for the French though with a 4th gaol sealing the victory, so Maritizio must wait for the result between France &amp; Nelson to see if they'll be playing 1st division football in September.<br>
						<b>Jetro hold Sala to goalless draw</b> In the final fixture of the day, Sala and Jetro played out a 0-0 draw as it got windier &amp; colder at Shin Koiwa. There were few chances at either end with the result being a fair reflection of the match. A major controversy was averted right at the end, as the floodlights were dimmed as Jetro were about to take a free kick from just outside the area. The ref allowed the kick to be taken before blowing the final whistle amid cries of &quot;Ref, I can't see a bloody thing!&quot; The kick missed, but had it gone in.....<br>

Vagabonds had arguably the better chances and possession in the 1st half, but in the 2nd it was Geckoes who were controlling most of the play. An unlucky deflection off the defenders knee from a near post corner settled the scoreline 1-0 in favour of Geckoes, but it was only thanks to a great save by keeper Rob Keyworth that they held onto the lead tid the end. This result puts them above Vagabonds in 3rd position in Div 2.</p>

								Feb 29th, <a href="http://www.ycac.or.jp/" target="_blank">YC&amp;AC</a>. Graeme Lane, captain of YC&amp;AC, caught up with Swiss Kickers' Striker Karl
								Hahne, in the hunt for this years Div 1 golden boot award, with a brace of goals against Jetro FC. In very windy conditions, both teams were
								having difficulty controlling the ball on the hard dry surface and chances were at a premium. Going in 1-1 at half-time, YC&amp;AC took the game to the opposition in the 2nd half,
								with most of the play at the Jetro end. 2 more goals by YC&amp;AC were enough to seal it and put them up to 3rd in Div 1 in what was described as '<i>
								a workman like performance to grind out a good win!'</i> by their captain.</P>

It was a different story in the 2nd half though, as Swiss seemed to overwhelm the French scoring 5 with just 1 in reply. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('04reps/swissvfrance.html','top=10,left=10,width=410,height=500,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=no,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">More...</a> or the <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank"><i class="txlink">French report</i></a><br>
						Swiss Kickers Sponsor Bernd was looking pleased on the touch line, with the Swiss proudly wearing their new <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/mats/photos/04/SwissJan04.jpg" target="_blank">German strip</a> provided by Bernd's Bar. It was also good to see Neil Day from our sponsor <a class="txlink" href="http://www.paddyfoleystokyo.com" target="_blank">PADDY FOLEYS</a> there to cheer his team Hibernian along. We hope you'll see more of Neil and our many other sponsors, by taking advantage of the many <a class="txlink" href="../../../pages/sponsors.html">DISOUNTS</a> offered by them to card carrying members of TML.</p>
					<h2 class=red>FATBOYS PULL OUT AT LAST MINUTE</h2>
					<p><b>Jan 9th, Tokyo. </b>The league was almost thrown into turmoil, before it even started, when Fatboys FC (a.k.a. British School dads) decided to pull out of the league Friday. Citing a lack of commitment from the players, the manager decided to pull out now rather than cause a bigger problem further down the line. With nothing to be done about this weekend, TML is having to now rethink the schedule for the coming weeks, something we'd hoped was fixed already. Well, these are the teething problems with a new league, we hope all teams will try to be flexible to accommodate this new challenge.</p>
					<h2 class=blue>IT's OFFICIAL - PUMA BALLS!</h2>
					<P><a href="http://www.PUMA.com/" target="_blank"><img src="../../../mats/banners/puma.gif" align=right width="136" height="99" border="0"></a><b>Dec 25th, Tokyo. A merry Christmas from <a href="http://www.PUMA.com/" target="_blank">PUMA</a> means new balls for the new league.</B><BR>

				<td><h2 class=blue>REGISTRATION CLOSED</h2>
								<P><b>Nov 15th, Tokyo. Last minute rush means 19 teams to start.</B><BR>
								Finally, the registration for Metropolis League has closed, with more teams than expected joining. Although we had been planning to have 2 leagues of 6 or 8
								teams, that will have to be changed to 9 &amp; 10 thanks to a few late entries. The split for the 2 Divisions should be quite a logical choice but has yet to be decided.<BR>
								<B class=blue>BFC, Swiss, Hibs, France, YC&amp;AC, Sala FC, Kanto Celts, BEFC, Maritizio, JET's, Geckoes, Jetro, Vagabonds, Shane FC, Barbarians, Nelson FC(JP Morgan), Nova FC, Dutch Embassy, Fatboys.</B><BR>
								With teams still trying to complete their matches in other leagues and cups, christmas &amp; New Year, it now appears best to start the league in the New Year.
								We hope to have a small New Year 7 a side tourney to kick things off and then go from there. <BR>

								The biggest Highland Games 5-a-side soccer tournament to date, saw 21 teams turn up to play football on a beautiful, sunny day. Last years champions, KFC hit
								trouble from the start, losing their captain, Kirk and a striker with injuries in the opening matches. Newcomers Shane FC put in a good performance as did the
								British Embassy but the team of the day were SALA FC. After 2 wins &amp; 2 draws in the league games, they seemed to rally for the semi's &amp; Finals eventually
								beating KFC 3-1 for the cup.<BR>

								A late drop-out by the French in the masters competition, meant one group only had three teams. This didn't stop the old boys having a good day out though,
								with many of the teams showing they still had what it takes on the field. British School Dads had a pretty easy run through the league, but couldn't score
								past BFC Masters until a penalty shoot out in the semi-finals. Local team Yamai FC were there opponents in the finals but with a 3-0 win, the Brit dads came
								out on top.<BR>
