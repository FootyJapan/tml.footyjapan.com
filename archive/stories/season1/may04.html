It was a close 1st half battle with Geckoes striker, Jonathon Rodrigues, heading home a corner to make it 1-0 just before half-time.<br>
						Mikkel Troen made it 2-0 soon into the 2nd half and <a href="http://www.wsgeckoes.net/" target="_blank">Geckoes</a> looked to be cruising, but <a href="http://www.saitamajetsfc.com/" target="_blank">JETs</a> were in no mood to give up and were awarded a Penalty after 70 minutes.<br>
						At 2-1, <a href="http://www.wsgeckoes.net/" target="_blank">Geckoes</a> were in danger or losing control, both of the game and their cool as they contested the penalty decision. They were even more upset as Tony Moore was shown his 2nd Yellow card for a foul and had to march. They hung on for the win though and Tony didn't seemed to upset that he'd miss facing the Swiss in the next match!<br>

						A single 2nd half goal by Turtle FC's Kunihiko Katase, made up for a penalty miss by team-mate Zako in the 1st half and was enough to see off the <a href="http://www.kantocelts.com" target="_blank">Celtic</a> challenge.<br>
						Turtle were awarded a penalty early in the 1st half but despite sending the <a href="http://www.kantocelts.com" target="_blank">Celt</a> keeper the wrong way, Zako saw his shot come back off the upright to be cleared by a defender. They had a couple more good chances, 1 hitting the bar and another being well saved, but they couldn't break the deadlock. <a href="http://www.kantocelts.com" target="_blank">Kanto Celts</a> worked hard as usual but couldn't find their form in front of goal either with their top striker Simon Gilhooly missing and things stayed level til half-time.<br>
						It stayed the same through most of the 2nd half until a probing ball put Katase through on goal for Turtle. He was quickly closed down by Celt keeper Rauri Hatchell but managed to just flick it over the advancing goalie to put Turtle in front.<br>
						Celts mounted their usual, final charge, with Captain Eric Persson urging his men on, but to no avail. With 2 losses from 2 their hopes of qualifying for round 2 are fading, whereas Turtle with 2 wins from 3 look in good shape.<br>

						<a href="http://www.salafc.com" target="_blank">Sala FC</a> held on for a tough 2-2 draw against a <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">French</a> team who really wanted all the points. <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">France FC</a> started the scoring through David Laviol after about 15 minutes but <a href="http://www.salafc.com" target="_blank">Sala</a> replied immediately with 2 quick goals from Kentaro Ishii. Then came controversy....<br>
						<a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">France FC</a> mounted a good attack, the shot being cleared from going in the top left corner. The French cry penalty, Sala cry no, the slightly unsighted ref points to the corner spot.<br>
						Whether it was the goalies fist or defenders head or fist, is history now, and the score stayed 2-1 till half-time.<br>
						<a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">France</a> got their equalize early in the 2nd half through a great 30 yard volley from Laurent Frisch that went in off the back post leaving the keeper little chance. <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">France</a> upped the pressure and Naoki Saito gave Douglas Draper a torrid time at left back for <a href="http://www.salafc.com" target="_blank">Sala</a>. No more goals were to come though and <a href="http://www.salafc.com" target="_blank">Sala</a> were relieved to hear the final whistle &amp; get into the shade, while the over-heating French were still debating the 1st half call. With just Nova to play though, <a href="http://www.francefc.com" target="_blank">France FC</a> look in good shape for going to the next round.<br>

						2 very depleted squads, <a href="http://www.bfctokyo.com" target="_blank">Vagabonds</a> more so with just 10 men &amp; no keeper, lined up for the final game of the day. Perfidious Albion missing Captain Simon &amp; Biffa amongst others, just got an eleventh man turn up before kick off and in the late afternoon heat, the extra man made a big difference. Having a 'real' keeper helped, as it was lack of experience between the posts that contributed to many of the goals against <a href="http://www.bfctokyo.com" target="_blank">Vagabonds</a>, despite the valliant efforts of the volunteers.<br>
						Sami Benlassoud opened the scoring for Albion midway through the 1st half and it was soon followed by a great 30 meter strike from Simon Woolhouse.<br>
						2-0 at half-time and <a href="http://www.bfctokyo.com" target="_blank">Vagabonds</a> were still in with a chance, but changes in keepers, old age and a missing player all added up to another 4 goals against them.

					<p>The first of the new teams joining TML, Hachioji Wanderers, got a rather rough introduction when they had to meet Swiss Kickers in their FJ Cup group C meeting. Swiss of course had a point to prove after their previous weeks debacle and made the Wanderers the focus of their frustration at having lost the league. Wanderers Captain Andy Watanabe was well aware of the Swiss' reputation and hoped by playing them first, using an 'eleven men behind the ball' strategy, they may have a chance to get something... Right!<br>
						Even with many players missing, Swiss still had a formidable squad. German striker, Karl Hahne, showed why he was runner up in the Div 1 Golden boot, scoring a hat-trick within a 12 minute period late in the 1st half, followed by another goal in the 2nd half.<br>
						Wanderers Finnish Keeper, Jyrki Jaaskelainen (Well that's what the team-sheet says, honest) had a very busy day in the office, making multiple saves yet still having to pick the ball out of the back of the net at regular intervals. The score could have been double but the Wanderers took it in their stride well, even cheekily asking after the game &quot;was it 1 or 2 nil?&quot;<br>

						I was surprised turning up to the first match of the day, between Top of Div 1 - Hibs &amp; bottom of Div 2 - Barbarians, to find the score was 0-0 and even more surprised to see it stay that way till half-time. Of course, with 2 teams so far apart in the league, you'd expect lots of goals, but there in lies the glory of the cup. The underdogs were fighting back - well more like holding on by the skin of their teeth!<br>
						Things turned bad for Barbarians as a ball into the box was obstructed by the trailing arm of a defender, giving the ref no choice but blow for a penalty. This was duly dispatched by Keita Narama and seemed to open the flood-gates.<br>
						Mick O'Hagen was on fine form, firing home a couple of great strikes and fellow 'Oldboy' George Clarkson was well pleased to watch not one, but two of his back post headers beat the keeper. The 5-0 end result was soured for the Hibs though, as defender Karl Twohig was stretchered(well carried) off with torn ligaments in his ankle and now looking at another long lay off.<br>

						Turtle FC allowed new-comers Rikimaru FC, to come back twice but finally won 3-2 for their 1st victory in any TML game. Rikimaru, who will join Turtle in Division 2 next season, fought a spirited match giving their rivals little space to move. The young Japanese team closed Turtle down at every opportunity, which led to their 2nd goal directly. A Turtle defender tried to clear the ball at the edge of his box, his kick only coming straight back off the Rikimaru strikers, 'thigh'?, looping over the keeper &amp; in. A tad lucky but an equalizer all the same.<br>
						Turtle were having none of it though, taking advantage of a defensive error, scored the winner 10 mins from time.<br>

						After winning their 1st cup game last week, then a great early goal by striker Kuni Hosoi, Maritizio thought they were well on their way to qualifying for the quarter-finals, until France stepped it up a gear.<br>
						Hosoi's 1st half strike from the edge of the 18yd box, was one of Maritizio's few chances, where-as at the other end, France were causing all kinds of problems. Etsushi Yoshikoshi was on target twice as the French took a 3-1 lead into half-time.<br>
						Even the late arrival of John Ologbosere, could only provide one goal for Maritizio in the 2nd half, leaving them the task ahead of beating Sala if they want to progress in the cup, whereas the French still have 2 to play.</p>

				completed with a nice cross. The ball should have been cleared, but somehow made it through to the back post leaving an easy tap in for Alex Crawshaw's first goal. 1-0.<BR>
				Alex got his 2nd mid way through the 2nd half when he superbly trapped a though ball about 25 yards out. He looked up, saw the keeper off his line and expertly chipped him for 2-0.<BR>
