								</table><P><b>Feb 28th, Roppongi, Tokyo.</B>There's a guy works down Yoshinoya swears he's Elvis and he was spotted loitering outside Paddy Foley's on
								Saturday night after being presumed dead for almost 27 years. Clearly the lure of the formal launch of The Metropolis League had been too much and an
								impromptu gig from The King capped a rip-snorting evening. TML maestro Sid, and Paco, had of course planned long and hard for the event, which was
								superbly attended by many of the teams and sponsors involved in the new league. There was also fantastic food, a very amusing video with photos of
								players in the league 'doing their thing',  blue-suede crooning and a raffle, which was only marred by  French FC keeper "Elbow" Elliot walking off with about nine of the top
								prizes, claiming the French were "having dinner upstairs." Tres amusant. Things looked bleak for the Swiss at the start of the raffle but, as always,
								they sneaked a couple of late goals to win it in stoppage time. Even Elvis was speechless.<BR>
								Rumours that Kev "The Kit" Gray will play at the TML award ceremony in a similar jet-black wig and winkle-pickers are as yet unconfirmed. <BR>
								Congratulations must go to Sid and Paco for their tireless work in establishing TML, which has rapidly become THE league to be part of.<BR>

								<b class=red>CELTS ELBERED ASIDE BY DUTCH</b><BR>
								Feb 28th, OiFuto. A hatrick by Pieter Elbers helped the Dutch move up into 2nd position in the 2nd Division with a game in hand over the
								teams above and below it. They couldn't have asked for a better start, getting 1-0 up on the Kanto Celts with less than a minute played. Celts drew
								level after quarter of an hour, but goals 10 minutes either side of halftime, gave the flying Dutchmen a lead they held onto despite Celts pulling another
								one back.<BR><BR>
								<b class=red>LANE &amp; HAHNE NECK &amp; NECK FOR GOLDEN BOOT</b><BR>
								Feb 29th, <a href="http://www.ycac.or.jp/" target="_blank">YC&amp;AC</a>. Graeme Lane, captain of YC&amp;AC, caught up with Swiss Kickers' Striker Karl
								Hahne, in the hunt for this years Div 1 golden boot award, with a brace of goals against Jetro FC. In very windy conditions, both teams were
								having difficulty controlling the ball on the hard dry surface and chances were at a premium. Going in 1-1 at half-time, YC&amp;AC took the game to the opposition in the 2nd half,
								with most of the play at the Jetro end. 2 more goals by YC&amp;AC were enough to seal it and put them up to 3rd in Div 1 in what was described as '<i>
								a workman like performance to grind out a good win!'</i> by their captain.</P>

				by BFC Vagabonds in what was a send off game for long time BEFC player Tim Williams. They were lucky not to be forfieted a point as their bus dropped them off 5 mins before
				kick off time, many looking a bit bedraggled from the previous nights partying. It was also a match that introduced new referee Pietro Cristo to the TML fold, and a very good
				job he did as well. Vagabonds had arguably the best of chances, with one 35 yard volley producing a fine save from goalkeeper Giles Lever but at the end of the match , everyone
				seemed happy with the draw. P.A. are looking set to be promoted to the 1st Division for next season, 6 points clear with just 3 games to play!

								<b>Perfidious Albion got their 4th straight win</b> of the League, cementing their position at the top of Division 2. Their opposition, an under strength Nova FC
								who's captain suffered an unfortunate broken ankle after being run off a pavement by a drunken salaryman last week, started brightly despite their lack of
								players and looked set to force a draw. But it was one of Perfidious' goalies Keith Crowley, (playing outfield) who scored the winner just minutes from time to give the old 'BEFC' boys
								the full 3 points.<BR>
								<b>OiFuto.</B> Following Bolton's exploitation of the new interpretation of the offside rule this week, both Geckoes and the Dutch were subject to
								some interesting interpretations in their TML fixture. Both teams fell foul of decisions that would lead to long discussions in any league but it was
								Geckoes who yet again felt the hardest done by as they fell to their 2nd defeat.</P>

								France FC finally got the win they've been looking for at the expense of SALA FC, moving them off the bottom of Div 1 for the 1st time this season. Getting off to a great
								start, they were 2-0 up after only 5 minutes with a couple of well struck shots. With their charismatic captain not there to urge them on, (reportedly scouting for new talent
								on foreign shores...well sunbathing anyway!) there was always the danger that France may fade away again, as they did against Swiss and Jetro.<BR>
								A goal soon into the 2nd half eased their worries and sealed the Victory, with Sala getting a consolation goal 10 mins from time. Sala were left to ponder

Although BFC had the lions share of possession, a combination of poor finishing and resolute defending by YC&amp;AC, kept them at bay. Finally (after many previous claims) they were awarded a penalty in the 2nd half, nicely tucked away by Peter Adolphus, but should have wrapped things up when they forged a couple of clear openings in front of goal. BFC's lack of ability in the 6 yard box, wasn't a affliction shared by YC&amp;AC captain Graeme Lane, who nipped in front of the BFC defence in the dying seconds to latch onto a well placed free kick. A quick turn and shot at the near post robbed BFC of 2 points and left YC&amp;AC in good position to challenge for the title still.<br>

German striker Karl Hahne has his eyes on the Div 1 golden boot, scoring 4 in their victory and taking his tally to 6. It was not all one way traffic, as Maritizio put Swiss under pressure on a number of occasions, exploiting the weakness in the Swiss team from so many missing players. With games fixed far in advance, it's good to see that all teams suffer the same problems as missing players etc, no teams getting an advantage!

									<b>SHANE FINALLY GET GUNS BLAZING</b> Sundays game at Nodai in Saitama produced the TML result of the day, with lowly Shane FC handing out a footballing lesson to an under performing Vagabonds side, which had previously boasted 7 points from it's opening 3 matches. Shane FC was clearly up for the game and was very organized and focused on the task at hand and began swiftly to take the sluggish Vagabonds apart. Sloppy play and poor organization led to Shane taking a 0-4 lead into half time. The Vagabonds, clearly shell shocked, simply had no answer to the onslaught and went on to concede a further 4 goals with the match ending 0-8. <a href="javascript:popwindow('http://www.bfctokyo.com/archive/reports/2004/009.html','top=10,left=10,width=550,height=450,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more...</a><br>

								<P><b>Feb 1st, OiFuto Daini.</B> Kanto Celts got the call Liverpool were screaming for the night before but never got. "Was it ball to hand, or hand to ball?"
								Kazu had no doubt as the hapless Shane defender went in the book, and the ball in the goal from the penalty spot. Playing on the astro-turf (read that Asteroid
								rock) pitch at OiFuto, both ref and players alike were often left confused since chalk lines drawn on the pitch for American Football &amp; futsal, hadn't
								been removed, This left the ground looking like some ancient Andean, Alien landing site from Chariots of the Gods.<BR>

								<BR><b>Sala got their 2nd win of the campaign</b> with a narrow 2-1 win over Nelson. Had the outcome of the game been different, a controversial moment
								where a Sala goal was disallowed as the keeper was down injured, could have sparked problems. In the end though, young Brookey, who'd been unlucky not
								to be credited with last weeks goal, scored one this week in their 2-1 victory.
