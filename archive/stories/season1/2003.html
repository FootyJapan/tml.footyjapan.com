								<P><b>Nov 15th, Tokyo. Last minute rush means 19 teams to start.</B><BR>
								Finally, the registration for Metropolis League has closed, with more teams than expected joining. Although we had been planning to have 2 leagues of 6 or 8 
								teams, that will have to be changed to 9 &amp; 10 thanks to a few late entries. The split for the 2 Divisions should be quite a logical choice but has yet to be decided.<BR>
								<B class=blue>BFC, Swiss, Hibs, France, YC&amp;AC, Sala FC, Kanto Celts, BEFC, Maritizio, JET's, Geckoes, Jetro, Vagabonds, Shane FC, Barbarians, Nelson FC(JP Morgan), Nova FC, Dutch Embassy, Fatboys.</B><BR>
								With teams still trying to complete their matches in other leagues and cups, christmas &amp; New Year, it now appears best to start the league in the New Year. 
								We hope to have a small New Year 7 a side tourney to kick things off and then go from there. <BR>

								The biggest Highland Games 5-a-side soccer tournament to date, saw 21 teams turn up to play football on a beautiful, sunny day. Last years champions, KFC hit 
								trouble from the start, losing their captain, Kirk and a striker with injuries in the opening matches. Newcomers Shane FC put in a good performance as did the 
								British Embassy but the team of the day were SALA FC. After 2 wins &amp; 2 draws in the league games, they seemed to rally for the semi's &amp; Finals eventually 
								beating KFC 3-1 for the cup.<BR>

								A late drop-out by the French in the masters competition, meant one group only had three teams. This didn't stop the old boys having a good day out though, 
								with many of the teams showing they still had what it takes on the field. British School Dads had a pretty easy run through the league, but couldn't score 
								past BFC Masters until a penalty shoot out in the semi-finals. Local team Yamai FC were there opponents in the finals but with a 3-0 win, the Brit dads came 
								out on top.<BR>
