								<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 26th September</b><br>
									After 2 successive defeats in the opening 2 games the Panthers needed a result against a Sala team who had also made a slow start to the season with 1 point from 2 games. A few surprises pre kick-off, losing 2 players through injury including our big centre half, forced a re-shuffle that saw Peter Swinney move into centre half against his former club.<br>
									The biggest surprise came from the Panthers' Brazilian midfielder Frank who rocked up in a rapid Audi sports car (we still don't know exactly who it belongs to) but no models accompanied him this time unfortunately. After spreading out 8 people between 3 cars from Shibuya we were on our way to Chiba hoping not to run into the JEF Utd traffic.<br>

									Last time King George FC met El Diego in Horisaki Koen, KGFC was in its infancy and El Diego played a neat, attacking brand of football for which their namesake was renowned. The outcome; 3-2 to El Diego. Almost two years on both teams, now playing in the second division, went into the game looking for their first win of the new season.<br>

									As we started the walk from Soga station to Fukuda Denshi there was the familiar &lsquo;Match Day&rsquo; tension and crackle in the air. Vendors lined the way to the stadium and people walking the streets* could purchase Donner kebabs, yakitori and beer at the stalls. New recruit Nick Pike was obviously impressed at how big the build up for a Vagabonds game is and how big the stadium was too&#x2026;&#x2026;.until he realized that we weren&rsquo;t playing JEF united and the pitch is actually behind the stadium proper.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Vagabonds clinical organizational machine was in evidence as we not only had remembered that the Embassy play in red and remembered that Muzzy lost our bibs, but actually remembered to buy some in the frantic 3 month period since we last played them.

									The Vags pitched up at the venerable Hachioji-koen riven with rumours of various infidelities amongst the ranks. A couple of heavy weight superstars were spotted down The Pong with fit women allegedly costing 250 sweet ones for an evening.<br>

									All played very well today.<br>

									On a balmy night in the far-flung reaches of Chiba, the Geckoes battled bravely to 3 hard-earned points against a strong Panthers side.<br>
									The first half started off fairly evenly, but it was the Geckoes who would strike first.<br>
									<br>
									After Andy Gill beautifully cushioned the ball off his back (he went up for a header, got spun round and the ball hit him on the arse) the ball broke to Scandinavian schemer Mikel Troen, who took a touch to steady himself before neatly dispatching a volley into the corner of the Panthers net.<br>

									BFC continued their fine start to the season with another clean sheet and a much deserved 3.0 victory over Swiss Kickers. In the words of the referee, &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the most beautiful game I&rsquo;ve ever seen&rdquo;, but there was still plenty to admire on the pitch - particularly BFC&rsquo;s dazzling new neon orange, black and white kit. Not everyone was impressed with the new Blackpool image however; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Schoolboy&rdquo; remarked Jon Day, when discovering the numbered shorts. <b><a class="txlink" href="0911bfc.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

									And so it was that the newly sponsored Panache Panthers made their Divison 1 debut and there was certainly no better way to hit the ground running or rather panting, than the challenge of facing last season's Div 1 champs the mighty Hibs. Confusing sat navs and vomiting centre-backs combined to ensure that 10 of the Panthers arrived with 10 minutes to kick off. No complaints from the 2 Panthers who had arrived on time Frank and Sho who had made sure to intimidate the opposition upon arrival by bring some Division 1 quality girlfriends with them.<br>

									Six-nil will do for starters and not bad for a team fielding no major pre-season signings. Clinical finishing and some impressive possession football did for a Sala side which was never really at the races.<br>
									<br>
									Deepest Saitama. Train hell. How many years have we been doing this for. Jay Bailey back in the line-up. Old school. If only we still had the 'Eigotown' kit.<br>
									<br>
									Two minutes gone: 1-0. It usually takes at least an hour to break down Sala, who will have had the hump at letting an up-and-under slip bobble all the way through to Paul Wadsworth, who cheekily prodded the ball home to leave Filet Mignon a little crispy around the edges.<br>
