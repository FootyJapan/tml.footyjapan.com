								<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 29th August</b><br>
									Finally, after the ennui of the world cup (apart from the England bits &#150; tee hee) we got back to the stuff that matters. A relatively impromptu gathering of certain Vags alumni as of a Friday evening in some subterranean area of fashionable Hammamatscho brought forth reminisces of self injury during childhood and later life. Assorted tidbits were: Axed himself in the forehead whilst chopping wood upwards / Tested how far his finger could go in a mangle before getting caught &#150; it did / Attempting to solve a mysterious blockage in a science lab by running a Bunsen burner along the highly combustible filled tubing (goggles off cause it wasn&rsquo;t cool) / Stabbing himself through the foot with a pitchfork whilst telling his younger brother that he was too young for this kind of thing&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.Christ&#x2026;it&rsquo;s a wonder anybody in the team can kick the ball in the right direction, never mind score goals and win games..<br>

								<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 29th August</b><br>
									After 7 seasons in Division 2, Barbarians finally ended in Division 3 and played their first game of its 2010 campaign on a nice but still hot Sunday evening in YCAC.<br>
									The World Cup being already forgotten (unless you are Spanish), we still had some reminder of this tournament by playing with a real Jabulani (despite our keeper complaints), the Vuvuzella being replaced by the children&rsquo;s noise from YCAC pool in one of the last day of the summer..<br>

								<p><b>Sunday August 22nd 2010 &#150; YCAC</b>.<br>
									YCFC showed once again that they are the team to beat in 7 a side competition as they took the honors in the fiercely contested Summer 7s tournament.<br>
									<br>
									The defending champions met BFC in the first semi final. It was a cagey start to the game, both teams playing cautiously &amp; no doubt trying to adapt to the searing heat. The deadlock was eventually broken when YCFC&rsquo;s ever dependable talisman Anthony Savage volleyed the ball home after good build up play from Matt Wallace and Mikey Taw. This kicked started the game into life and both teams began to play more free flowing football.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									BFC then leveled the score, a fierce shot well saved by YCFC&rsquo;s keeper Mark Harrison, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to keep out Shosuke Yamagishi who slotted home to make it 1-1. <b><a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/archive/stories/0910/0822Summer7s.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>

									BFC scrambled their way past competitive opposition to top group C while YCAC strolled comfortably past their contemporaries in group D to both move into the semi finals.<br>
									<br>
									Celts sparked off the evening with a 3 &#150; 0 drubbing over FC Dinos on pitch B. The sizable squad aiding recovery on what was a very warm and humid evening.<br>
									<br>
									A far tighter match could be seen on pitch A as group seed BFC took on FC International with FC Int taking early control of the affair.&nbsp;<br>

									It was Hibs and YCFC who battled humid conditions to wrap up their group qualifying in style to move onto the finals on August 22nd.<br>
									&nbsp;Baking conditions were pleasantly alleviated by a cooling bay breeze that couldn't have been timed better as 6 teams convened at YCAC for the first of 2 group stages yesterday evening.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The ever present and courageous boys from Shane FC braved the Hanabi packed trains on their mission from Saitama, as did the Tokyo based teams Hibs, Sarugaku FC and Swiss.&nbsp; <b><a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/archive/stories/0910/0801Summer7s.html" target="_blank">more</a></b><br>
