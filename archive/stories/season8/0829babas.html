									<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 29th August</b><br>
										After 7 seasons in Division 2, Barbarians finally ended in Division 3 and played their first game of its 2010 campaign on a nice but still hot Sunday evening in YCAC.<br>
										The World Cup being already forgotten (unless you are Spanish), we still had some reminder of this tournament by playing with a real Jabulani (despite our keeper complaints), the Vuvuzella being replaced by the children&rsquo;s noise from YCAC pool in one of the last day of the summer...<br>
										We lined up a mixture of old-time-members Barbarians and new recruits, with Terry in goal, Kimura-Fred-Hideki-Kaneko in defense, Paul-Ken-Koby-Russell in the midfield, relying on the young legs of Yusuke and Toshi up-front. Having the luxury of 3 subs, the tactic was to give everything and then enjoy a rest to rotate the team.<br>
										The game started well for Barbarians, getting 1-0 up in the first 15 minutes, thanks to Yusuke weighting his 45 kilos (sweat included) on the back of a Guarana Republic defender to score an own-goal, following a nice cross from Koby on the right. Barbarians could have been 3 or 4-0 up in the first half, but the lack of finishing (deja-vu?) kept the score as-is after 45 minutes. In all honesty and if not for Terry&rsquo;s excellent saves and a bit of luck (a screamer on the top corner of the goal from Guarana excellent forward from 12 yards out), Barbarians could also have had to settle for a draw at half time.<br>
										The second half started under the same tactics with a few substitutions, except for Yusuke who was punished and stayed on the pitch (&ldquo;until you score!&rdquo; told Fred) to compensate his misses in the first half. A long goal kick from Fred to the half-line, relayed by a header from Paul, launched Yusuke who calmly scored for a 2-0 lead despite off-side claims from the opponents. The excellent referee of the evening disallowed these calls and pointed for everybody to rejoin the center of the pitch for the restart.<br>
										This is when the old legs and lungs (or what is left of it) from the Barbarians defense started to show-up... Not easy to contain young, speedy and excellent forwards, when your average age of the back 5 (keeper included) is well over 40... A well-taken header on a free-kick converging to the goal made it 2-1 for Guarana, while a diverted shot made it 2-2 as an own-goal leaving Terry diving to the wrong side... 10 minutes to go, having been in this situation many times last season, the only difference this Sunday night being that our forwards were able to continue to attack...<br>
										Relentless pushes forward from Toshi, Wakana and our midfields paid, Ken Esparza finishing the game with a powerful shot after a scramble in the Guarana box...<br>
										The ref blowing the end of the game soon after the restart, Barbarians could breathe a little bit and start their new season with a victory against a very good Japanese team. They will make a few teams suffer this season, if they play as yesterday evening.<br>
										Other teams in Division 3, you are warned now.<br>
										Man of the match: Yusuke Onuma (helped on the first goal, scored one, and missed many).<br>
										Very good and solid performance from the Referee... Good to see a game played in very positive spirit and well controlled.<br>
