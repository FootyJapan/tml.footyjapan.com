									<p><b>Hachioji Park Monday 11th Feb</b>,<br>
										After a&nbsp;few disappointing results the Hibs came out Monday night with&nbsp;a full&nbsp;squad and plenty of motivation.&nbsp;On the beautiful Hachioji pitch, under the lights, both teams were up for it.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Jets pressure the ball relentlessly and can make it hard to play, but after a few minutes the Hibs wrestled control of the game and began to knock the ball around. We had some forays early (turns out&nbsp;new recruit Marcio is really fast) and got our break when Dre got service in the box and laid it off for Mike, who burned his man with a step-over, then dribbled past three more, teed up his left foot and rifled it far right - a beauty, 1-0 Hibs. Next we broke out on the counter, Marcio took the ball wide left at full speed and sent it across to Mike, who was chopped&nbsp;down in the box, but got up and calmly&nbsp;netted the PK, 2-0.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Our&nbsp;next goal was fortunate - Tomo got free wide right and blasted in a hard cross, it hit a Jets defender and looped over their keeper's head. The Jets had&nbsp;a good chance in the half off a corner, Jay cleared the cross but right to their man on the edge of the box, he fired a good shot low left but Hitoshi and Yasu were there for the save. 3-0 at the half.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In the second half both the Hibs and Jets&nbsp;threw everyone forward and the teams went back and forth on the attack. Hibs struck first - Dre again played a perfect pass, this time to Yama, who curled it in nicely to the left without breaking stride, 4-0. Later Jets struck back, they caught us on the break with numbers and eventually Nate ended up wide right with time to shoot, not good,&nbsp;he left Hitoshi no chance,&nbsp;4-1. Finally Kuni, hardest working player for the Hibs&nbsp;all night, put a ball into the box and Dre got a well-deserved goal, sliding it around their sprawling keeper for the 5-1 final.<br>
										<br>
										There could have been more goals as both sides hit the woodwork, but the final score reflected the run of the game. A good win for the Hibs.<br>
