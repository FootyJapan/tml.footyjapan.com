									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 14th October</b>,<br>
										More bitter medicine for the Vagabonds. The Vags stomach got stapled at the start of this season, leaving us chronically starving for goals, but on the way to a leaner, fitter team and a more competitive opposition to our Division 1 rivals. If you ignore, for a moment, the goal difference each week so far &#150; the only constant &#150; we have improved our game steadily week on week. After all what is a scoreline but a few snapshots in 90 minutes of football?<br>
										<br>
										Up against Sala the Vagabonds midfield held the aces. But the 3 man defense, known to suffer wobbles occasionally when under extreme pressure, was nerve-wracking to be part of today. From the Vagabonds goal, a chattering of teeth was audible. After 20 minutes Sala scored an improbable goal. A sidefooter hit at 2 inches from the byline - Taylor and the defense didn't do the math &#150; and the kind of goal that leaves you wondering what went wrong and but offers no hints.<br>
										<br>
										Before our collective daze lifted Sala hit the target again and as often happens this season, our stout rally, through the remainder of the first half and well into the second, didn't manufacture any goals. But no matter, as I said earlier, because during these rallies Vagabonds are winning the game, if only temporarily and irrespective of the goal tally.<br>
										<br>
										Sala may have the drabbest name in the league but their football is, to quote Alaister Himmer  &ldquo;un baton rouge&rdquo; or something like that. They are good. With their rapid switching between wings and attacking triangularations, they have an astringent quality.<br>
										It was only in the last 10 minutes  though that they found their way through to score again. A fine early cross and a header of rare power and accuracy from the edge of the box stunned us. &ldquo;Its that common?&rdquo; we thought, then snapped to and made notes for our next meeting on January 14th 2008.<br>
										<br>
										Sala were better than us, and during that exhausting final 10 minutes they scored a fourth goal. In sum, a lapse in the first half and sheer fatigue in the second half were key catalysts in Sala`s two goal-scoring pulses. Sort that out by killing the rabbit of self-doubt, and getting in shape and the Vagabonds will learn how changeable snapshots in time can be. Then winning will become our expectation again. <br>
