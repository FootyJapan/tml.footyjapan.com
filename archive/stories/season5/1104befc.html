									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 4th November</b>,<br>
										At last, the monkey is off the back.  The Embassy are off the mark in Division 1 having finally delivered on the promise hinted at in patches throughout the season.  And while a casual glance at the score line may give a slightly false account of the match as a whole all would agree that the three points were played for and got.<br>
											The first half was a tense, tight affair more noticeable for the sloppy passing on both sides than for the flowing football.  Given that this was at Hachioji Koen it can&rsquo;t have been the surface&rsquo;s fault.  Neither side was able to make anything of the few chances created and when the half time whistle blew both sides probably went in thinking that the points were there for the taking.<br>
											In recent weeks the Embassy has waited until it was on the back foot, perhaps even several goals down, before really playing some decent football but this time it was the Embassy that took the lead when Satoshi challenged bravely to head in Steve&rsquo;s cross from the left after left-back Ryan had taken matters into his own hands and made a driving run up the flank.  Moments earlier, during the break, Ryan had said he thought that us full-backs needed to press more and support the attack.  Well, indeed, point taken. <br>
											A key factor in deciding the second half was the late arrival of new recruit Yuya; his fresh legs, speed and control causing problems for the opposition as soon as he took the pitch.  Shortly after his introduction he latched onto a ball forward from Hal and, having taken a moment to look up, lifted a delicate lob over the advancing keeper.<br>
											These were dizzy times indeed.  The Embassy were two goals up and looking good.  But the Saitama Jets were not about to roll over, as all who have played against them will know.  They continued to battle all over the pitch and were rewarded when a fast attack caught the Embassy back-line off guard, their striker giving Taka no chance.  The Jets had their tails up and were on level terms soon afterwards when one of their forwards was able to evade the off-side trap to meet a ball in from the right with a neat headed finish which again Taka had no chance of stopping.      <br>
										 At this point the Embassy could well have settled for their first point of the season and left it there, or worse capitulated.  But too often recently the points have gone elsewhere despite the Embassy putting in good performances and this day that was not going to happen.  With both sides increasingly committing men forward in search of the winner the game became more stretched and it was the Embassy that was able to exploit the extra space.  The frontline players began putting together neat combinations with Alex acting as a fulcrum between Jorge, Tetsu and Steve on the left and Yuya, Hal and Kotaro on the right.  <br>
										The refusal to give up soon began paying dividends.  Alex fed Jorge out wide on the left.  Jorge wriggled free of the defense before squaring a pass to Steve who deftly controlled the ball with his first touch beating his marker before rolling the ball into the far bottom right corner.    <br>
										The game was effectively ended as a contest (although no one stopped running till the final whistle) when a fast counter attack found Yuya running on to a ball into the area.  History repeated itself as once again he had the coolness of head to lift the ball beyond the advancing keeper.<br>
										With the Embassy now running rampant even central defenders were seen charging past the half way line looking for a sniff of glory but the final goal belonged to Steve who met a Yuya cross from the right with a looping header that was over the keeper&rsquo;s fingers but under the bar.<br>
										So how to explain this reversal of fortunes for the Embassy?  Five goals scored, three of them headers?  <br>
										It certainly wasn&rsquo;t a reflection on the opposition.  The Jets and the Embassy have met countless times recently, especially in Nagano, and the games are always keenly contested.  The Jets played a hard physical game but also moved the ball around well.  They were certainly no less of an opponent than almost all the teams the Embassy has faced (and lost to) this season.<br>
										A key factor has to be the fact that, for this first time since August the Embassy has been able to field a back-line of out-and-out defenders.  Injuries, repatriations and work have forced the Embassy to use players out of position in the centre of defense and while all who have played there have acquitted themselves admirably it is the nature of the position that you can have an excellent seventy eight minutes, have a couple of lapses of concentration and be badly punished for them.  (Whereas, of course, a striker can be non existent for seventy-eight minutes, have a couple of moments of inspiration and go home the hero.)  The return of Gary from injury alongside Mark gave the Embassy a foundation upon which this performance was built.  But this alone is not the full story as everyone that played for the Embassy put in a good, committed performance.  <br>
										Alex is certainly growing into his roll as point man and all the attacking players seem to be benefiting from the new formation.  With Ferdy and Will doing battle in the midfield, Taka growing in stature and confidence between the posts and quality new players coming in like Hal and Yuya there is certainly no reason to think that the Embassy can&rsquo;t kick on from here and start climbing the table.  After all we still have everyone to play again.  We owe some of you a full eighty minutes.    <br>
										<br>
										Man of the Match:	Ryan Loughins<br>
										Not only did he perform his defensive duties with aplomb but also provided support and drive going forwards, especially when his run led to the opening goal.<br>
