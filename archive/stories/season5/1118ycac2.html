										<br>
										YCAC Seconds record prior to this game had such pleasing symmetry&nbsp;- Played 4, Won 2, Lost 2, Goals For 11, Goals Against 11 - it seemed a shame to play and muck those well-balanced stats up.&nbsp; But duty called.........<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A typically bright and blustery day at the YCAC for the 5th game of this campaign saw us set to play league new boys Panthers.&nbsp; Having done our usual rigorous scouting and pre-match preparation,&nbsp;we knew they had given a number of teams a very close game and we expected similar.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a big squad&nbsp;for the 5th game in a row, with the full 5 subs available and this always gives&nbsp;Benitez-type issues.&nbsp; Fortunately the &quot;squad&quot; culture that our new&nbsp;skippa WingCo Lawrence&nbsp;has brought to the team means this is never as difficult&nbsp;as you might expect.<br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/07/1118ycacvpan3.jpg" alt="" height="246" width="233" align="left" border="0" hspace="4">&nbsp;<br>
										We started very brightly and in the first 20 I think were good value for the 2-0 lead.&nbsp; Both goals came from nice moves down the right, one finished neatly by Pete Fairbrother who picked his spot from 15 yards,&nbsp;and the other headed over the keeper and in by Kaz.&nbsp; That Phil Denham and Matt Tuck were involved in both was fairly typical of their play during the whole match.&nbsp; It was not one-way traffic, however, and a piece of very quick thinking by the Panthers centre forward saw him steal the ball from our keeper&nbsp;Paul Blamire's clutches&nbsp;and slide it in from an angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt&nbsp;made it 3-1 shortly afterwards and I wish I could tell you about that goal, but was&nbsp;answering a call of nature&nbsp;at the time after a particulary heavy night.&nbsp; I was back in time, however,&nbsp;to see Matt locate the upright with a fine shot shortly afterwards <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Second half we made three changes, Kaz, Rob and Alex taking a well-earned break and making room for Mikey, Taiki&nbsp;and Gavi (n)........you know, at times we are even sounding like a proper team.&nbsp; I think we had the lions share of chances in the 2nds half but failed to convert.&nbsp; <img src="../../../mats/photos/07/1118ycacvpan5.jpg" alt="" height="124" width="169" align="right" border="0" hspace="4">On the other hand, Panthers were awarded a penalty (correctly) which&nbsp;was converted and as result we seemed to be hanging on for the last 10 minutes when really we should perhaps have been a wee bit more comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										I thought we played well across the whole back 4, thanks again to Paul Blamire for stepping in, tirelss effort across the board in midfield and upfront.&nbsp; Also&nbsp;congratulations to Min Sung for the fastest yellow card ever awarded to a substitute..<br>
