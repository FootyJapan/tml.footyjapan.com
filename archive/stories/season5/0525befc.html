									<p><b>Daito Bunka, Sunday 25th May</b>,<br>
										Things were certainly not looking good at half time.&nbsp; Perhaps the knowledge that a win would be enough to keep the Embassy in the First Division was playing on our minds (well actually a draw but you must never think like that, right?)&nbsp; While the first half had not been without incidents &#150; Tetsu and Taka combining well down the left flank, Golden Boot contender Steve Lidbury cracking a shot just over from a tight angle and later forcing a save from the keeper, and fellow forward Alex seeing a bobbling shot cleared off the line &#150; for the most part the Embassy was not at its best.&nbsp; Too many times players were calling for &ldquo;cool heads&rdquo; before punting first-time balls long themselves.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And then, about ten minutes shy of half time the Embassy again fell victim to its vulnerability to decent balls lobed into the box when a Celts forward leaped impressively to beat &lsquo;keeper Keith&rsquo;s outstretched arms to make it 1 &#150; Nil.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So halftime it was.&nbsp; A rousing speech (think Henry V rounded out with lots of swearing or Braveheart without Mel Gibson&rsquo;s arse), a slight tactical switch and the Embassy took to the field ready to make things right and save their season.&nbsp; And within a few minutes things were looking considerably better.&nbsp; The aforementioned tactical switch had been to move the creative, dynamic talents of Yuya into the middle and fill the absent slot on the right with relatively new regular member Osamu.&nbsp; When Alex, so often the calmest head when all around are loosing theirs, ambled his way to the corner flag he seemed to have gone down a cul-de-sac but with three Celts defenders drawn to him he released the ball back to Osamu who took one touch to steady himself and then let fly with his weaker, left foot.&nbsp; The shot left the &lsquo;keeper no chance.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With survival back on the relief was palpable and with it came a renewed belief.&nbsp; Captain Ferdy and Yuya began to wrestle control of the midfield and as the Embassy started playing like the team it can be a slew of chances followed.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										It had been whispered, after a recent miss against the Jets, that perhaps heading was Osamu&rsquo;s one weakness, that he had an Achilles&rsquo; forehead, if you will (sorry, very poor.)&nbsp; However, it would seem that this is not&nbsp;the case as he completed his hatrick with two off his noggin.&nbsp; The first came when, having made his way to the byline, Yuya played a delightful cross into the area.&nbsp; The &lsquo;keeper could only touch the ball on and Osamu was there to nod it in coolly.&nbsp; His third also received a little good luck when a speculative over-the-head ball from Steve was headed out of the &lsquo;keeper&rsquo;s hands by a Celts defender.&nbsp; The ball looped on and Osamu again nodded home calmly.&nbsp; The two finishes were more than enough to put paid to the whispers and an end to pitiful jokes about Ancient Greek warriors.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sandwiched between these two headers, Steve Lidbury also managed to bag his thirteenth goal of his remarkable season.&nbsp; When no-one seemed to be able to control a ball into the area from Hal on the left it finally fell to the Embassy marksman who opted for a rare right-footed finish.&nbsp; It was no more than Steve deserved after another tireless performance, his goal haul all the more impressive having come from a team rooted to the bottom of the table for most of the season.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Embassy ended the match four to the good but there could easily have been more.&nbsp; A fast break initiated by central defender Gary lead to some neat interplay between the two Embassy forwards and it was only the slightest of touches from a defender that prevent Steve from converting Alex&rsquo;s superb low cross.&nbsp; Another glorious chances went begging when full back Tim, admittedly on the back of another lung busting charge forward having won the ball in defence, couldn&rsquo;t temper his run to meet Yuya&rsquo;s centre after perhaps the Embassy&rsquo;s best move of the game and another exquisite ball from Alex to find Yuya in the build up.&nbsp; But such things were soon forgotten (right, fellas?)<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The giddying prospect of another season of first division football did lead to a lapse in concentration towards the end of the game and the Celts seemed determined not to let the Embassy have things easy.&nbsp; Earlier in the half a goal bound low drive from the edge of the area had just been turned round the post by defender Mark.&nbsp; And then with just less than ten minutes to go another quality ball in, this time from the right, and another massive leap resulted in a second for the boys in green and white.&nbsp; There followed a tense final few minutes as the Celts pressed for a third.&nbsp; However, with all hands to the pump, Richie and Eddie on to settle the ship and &lsquo;keeper Keith equal to anything that sneaked (leaked?&nbsp; Or is that taking the nautical theme too far?) through, the backline was not breached again.&nbsp; The final score read 4 &#150; 2 to the Embassy and more importantly, safety.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										When seen in the context of the whole season the Embassy avoiding the drop could appear to be something of a Fulham-esque, Houdini act.&nbsp; However, having overcome the problems that dogged the start of the season (the loss of key players to injury or their own countries) and having successfully integrated some new, talented players into the lineup the last few months have seen a much-improved side.&nbsp; Indeed on the back of performances like this the Embassy can look forward to TML 6 with high hopes.&nbsp; We stayed up this time, next time we aim for the top!<br>
