									<p><b>Yoyogi Park, Saturday 22nd March</b>,<br>
										  I've always had a thing for nurses. Then again, I am a just an ordinary guy. But the extent to which some BFC members are going to mutilate themselves for some attention from the white skirts is getting ridiculous.<br>
										<br>
										Here's  the list of shame in alphabetical order. Al; ACL,  Brian; Bloody nipples, Carlos; Achilles' heel, Day; torn calf muscle,  Neil; alleged dodgy back among others, Shosuke; exploding ankle.<br>
										<br>
										 What should have been a walk in Yoyogi park turned  into another masochistic 90 minutes of algolagnia. <br>
										<br>
										 Gordie, the wise one's pre-match prediction (Exhaustively edited of course):<br>
										<b>BFC</b> : Top of the league title holders, three on the trot including a classy comeback against YCAC and a demolition of the Celts.<br>
										<b>Embassy</b> : First season in the top league proving perhaps too much for the attaches with only 7 points from 13 games. Honestly cant see BFC dropping points here especially before showdown with the other Big three to end the season.<br>
										<br>
										   BFC however turned up with a bare 11 while Carlos and Neil discharged themselves for the day to support the troops. Ten minutes in, Al gets a call from Sho in hospital and he limps off for the Gokon with the nurses. Neil, who was hobbling the line was asked to strap on and try to...Im not really sure, perhaps limp into the opposition? Then came Dr. Phil's case of gross malpractice (sorry, couldnt resist) to hand a goal to the embassy.  BFC now almost in rigor mortis seemed to lack any ideas and resorted to lots of fumbling around the box without any real action.<br>
										Something special was clearly needed to pry the briefcases open and it arrived in the form one of Evans' long limbs. The Kenyan calmly chested down a throw in from the left, and with only one peek he picked his spot before swinging his left member to stick the half volley in the bottom left corner from the edge of the box. The goal seemed to breathe some life back into BFC with Pablo puttin in some meaty tackles in the middle and new boy Keisuke (Case-K)  turning the heat on in the box. Against the run of play however, a hopeful embassy punt upfront was met by a streaking Steve Lidbury who did well to get to the ball and loop his header over the onrushing keeper . Agreed, a good poacher's goal, but no defense for the confusion between the keeper and the BFC backline.<br>
										However, it must be pointed out that BFC's attitude seems to have changed and just like in the epic YCAC game, we didn't resort to the customary biting of each other's heads off. With the mood positive and shouts of  &quot;It will come&quot;, BFC continued to throw bodies forward. Taka, puttin in a fine shift down the left continued BFC's newly learnt tactic of crossing the ball. Perhaps not knowing how to react to a cross, Jon, Keisuke, Gary and the Pink one were spotted running in all directions in the box managing to confuse the embassy defence and keeper who all stood by mesmerized as the inswingning ball bounced and ended in the back of the net. More ways than one to skin a cat  and sheepish looking Taka was mobbed by the rest of the herd who were happy with a goal in whatever shape or form. 2-2 at at the break.<br>
										  Halftime brought the rousing words from  Captain Day, &quot;We are all playing like muppets! Absolutely shite!&quot; and the muppets nodded in unison. So 11 soiled but roused muppets ran out into the second half looking to turn it around. The embassy boys, perhaps smelling a chance started the second half brightly with Alex pulling their strings in the middle and their Italian porn star upfront coming close. It was however another swing of the Kenyan's smoothly shaven left leg that changed the game. Collecting a loose ball halfway into the embassy's half, he leapt past two or three players before unleashing another zinger from the edge of the area that left the keeper no chance. Think skinny black John Arne Riise, shaven of course. With confidence oozing now, BFC started to show glimpses of their usual selves. Morson came agonizingly close when he sneaked  into the box unnoticed to meet Garry's quality corner with a firm downward header that bounced inches wide and the ginger one knew he should have done better. Keisuke continued to show what a jewel he might turn out to be with his direct run at defenders and amazing speed reminiscent of Sho before Sho shank resection became such a hit in the TML. However, the killer goal was proving elusive until an embassy defender decided to take matters into his own hands. Another BFC attack saw the lively Evans loading the gunpowder before the defender tried to swipe the ball away then act outraged when the Ref pointed to the spot.<br>
										The usual BFC suspects led by Dr. Phil were seen sniffing around but the Kenyan on his hat trick was having none of it. One step back, dispatches keeper the wrong way, 4-2 BFC. The Doctor presented his dissertation analyzing the penalty from all angles later that night but she was seen dozing halfway through. Game over? Sadly, old habits die hard.<br>
										  BFC, always up for a cheap thrill, decided it was time to spice things up. The self destruct button was sent for, a chance or two were gifted but not taken and BFC seemed disappointed. So a Penalty was presented.<br>
										Orlando got down superbly to his left and caught the otherwise well hit Peno. BFC decided to serve it on a platter now and this time the embassy finally obliged as His-name-is-Morson, James Morson, licensed to thrill(got 8 thou?), was caught playing with himself just outside the box.  A pass was slid between two other defenders before the embassy striker stroked it home. BFC, ecstatic by now,  tried to throw away the points again but Orlando, clearly having missed the plot pulled another amazing point blank save.<br>
										 The final whistle was greeted with huge groans from both sides. The Captain quickly convened a post mortem and share a few kind words. Words that will be left out here but words that have to be heeded by all those who heard. <br>
										  4 games to go, 3 of which are against 5 star Hibs(1 point off in 2nd), big rivals Sala (5 points off in 3rd with a game in hand) and Swiss (a few more points off in 4th but it's clockwork Swiss we are talkin here). <br>
										<br>
										Now if that is not givin you a thrill...<br>
