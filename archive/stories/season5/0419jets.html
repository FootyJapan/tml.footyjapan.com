									<p><b>Hachioji Park Saturday 19th April</b>,<br>
										With four games remaining of a wretched season Saitama Jets were wondering how, with no victories and only 3 points gained since winning their opening fixture in August, their TML 1 fate was till in their own hands.  Equally difficult seasons for newly promoted British Embassy and Vagabonds have left the three clubs adrift at the bottom the league, meaning two of the three will definitely be relegated.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets lined up against the Wall Street Geckoes, the only team they have beaten this season on (yet another) wind swept night at Hachioji Park on the evening of March 30th in what turned out to be an open and entertaining game.  The Jets opened the scoring early when Loren brought down a hopeful cross that had eluded everyone in the penalty area and smashed a low shot into the bottom left hand corner from 15 yards.  Saitama barely had time to enjoy the novelty of being in front before suicidal defending presented a Geckoe with the ball on the penalty spot and it was duly rocketed into the net.  Both defences were looking shaky, not helped by the slick conditions, and soon it was the Geckoes turn to blunder, presenting the Jets with a good chance that was not taken.  Just a minute later another lapse in concentration at the back enabled Yoshiba to capitalise to put the Jets 2-1 up.  The Geckoes&rsquo; reply was again instant, as their forward burnt past the Jets&rsquo; centre back and lashed an unstoppable shot into the net to level it at 2-2.  All this within the first 20 minutes and the rest of the half was quiet by comparison.<br>
										<br>
										The second half continued in the same vein &#150; neither side could rely on defending and so just attacked.  As the Geckoes pressed forward their lack of pace at the back was regularly exposed by Saitama counter attacks and punished by ruthless finishing.  First Shimizu, outstanding all game in his new left back position, picked out Kikuchi&rsquo;s run with a 30 yard pass and the Japanese striker made a strong run into the box, holding off a defender and coolly slotted the ball past the goalkeeper to make it 3-2 Jets.  Then Yoshiba, picking up a loose ball in the centre circle, sent Loren racing clear and the American made no mistake in scoring his second with a firm finish.  Finally, breaking up another Geckoes&rsquo; attack in midfield, Keating&rsquo;s lobbed pass put Gildart one-on-one with the &lsquo;keeper and the Jets top scorer gave him no chance to put Saitama into a commanding 5-2 lead and the clubs best TML1 result.  <br>
										<br>
										To be fair to the Geckoes, although they were clearly below their best they carved out at least as many chances as the Jets, but were let down by poor finishing and will no doubt feel that with a bit more composure could have taken something from the game.  But it was the Jets&rsquo; night and a timely three points to kick-start their relegation battle.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Hachioji Park Saturday 19th April</b>,<br>
										The Jets next game was against fellow relegation battlers British Embassy with defeat for either team making relegation a near certainty.  Given the stakes and the recent history between the teams it was a remarkably good natured contest with both teams going at it hard but fair and despite the controversial ending to the game went home on friendly terms.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets started very well enjoying the lions&rsquo; share of possession, but it was the Embassy who had the best chance.  A ball over the top caught out the Jets rearguard and put the Embassy winger through on goal, Harada in the Jets goal came sprinting out of his box although it was clear that he had scant chance of reaching the ball first, his charge though forced the chance to be taken early and the ball bounced harmlessly wide of the post.  The next 20 minutes was all Jets &#150; Keating&rsquo;s 20-yarder skimmed the bar, Gildart broke free on the left side of the area but his cross-shot rolled the wrong side of the right-hand post and Osawa took advantage of slack passing at the back to get one-on-one with the &lsquo;keeper who did well to block the shot and smother the ball at the second attempt.  The Jets tired a little and the Embassy came back into the game as half-time approached, but it was Saitama who came closest to breaking the deadlock in the final minute of the half when Mikey Passmore, on for the injured Yoshiba, sent a scuffed shot against the base of the post following more defensive high-jinks from the Embassy.  Half-time 0-0.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets carved out yet more opportunities in the second half with the Embassy restricted to breakaways or forcing defensive errors, meaning that &lsquo;keeper Harada was under-employed for significant stretches.  Kikuchi, who made a nuisance of himself all game, forced an opportunity with his persistence that the &lsquo;keeper parried and the rebound fell to Yoshiba whose effort from 8 yards was hacked off the line.  Next, Saitama caught the Embassy sleeping from a short corner and a driven cross from the edge of the box was almost turned in by Kikuchi, the ball then pin-balled around the area as various Jets took turns to try to smash it home but each effort was bravely blocked.  The Embassy were finding it difficult to get anything productive going in the final third and eventually the Jets pressure told as Turner&rsquo;s long pass was allowed to bounce in front of the defence allowing Kikuchi to take control and to eventually force the ball home from 6 yards to give Saitama a crucial and deserved lead with 12 minutes remaining.<br>
										<br>
										The embassy had no option but to push forward and this left gaps at the back which presented the Jets with two golden opportunities to make the game safe.  First Sasaki took out the entire Embassy defence with a fine 20 yard cross-field pass that put Gildart through, the prolific Canadian brought the ball down with his first touch and a second brought him inside the area and one-on-one with the &lsquo;keeper but his third sent the ball uncharacteristically over the bar.  Still the embassy couldn&rsquo;t fashion a passable opportunity and next Kikuchi was sent clear down the left, but with strike partner Gildart a 5 yard pass away to the right for a simple tap-in, the Japanese striker selfishly decided to go it alone and the chance was gone.  It was a decision that the Jets were to rue.<br>
										<br>
										The Embassy were becoming desperate and now every block that the Jets made resulted in a chorus of hand-ball appeals, every time an Embassy player slipped on the wet surface there were frenzied shouts for a penalty.  But surely a penalty in the final minute of a tense relegation battle has to be clear cut and not a result of spurious appeals, no matter how loud and frequent?  Apparently not.  Inside the last minute and another corner to the Embassy, the ball comes in, bodies flying through the air, now on the ground, yet more hopeful shouts, the shriek of the whistle &#x2026; penalty kick!  It was a brave decision from the ref&rsquo; and stunned Jets naturally protested, but of course to no avail.  Lidbury, the Embassy striker who&rsquo;d had a good game making the most of the meagre service he received, kept his head to smash home the penalty.  Harada did well to get to it but could only deflect the ball in to the roof of the net for 1-1.  With just seconds remaining the handbags inevitably came out and a metaphorical teddy bear was launched with some force by an incredibly, but perhaps understandably, frustrated Jet.<br>
										<br>
										A draw is not the end of the world and the result still leaves the Jets&rsquo; destiny in their own hands &#150; wins against Celts and Vagabonds will make Saitama safe for another season &#150; but it was difficult to see any positives as a gutted Saitama Jets team left Hachioji Park on Saturday night feeling like they had just been mugged.<br>
