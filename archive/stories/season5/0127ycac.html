									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 27th January</b>,<br>
										One of those days where everybody was a little quiet and frustrated at the end. Both teams thinking about 2 points lost rather than the 1 gained, no doubt. YCAC because we'd created the better chances throughout and spurned all except one. Celts, maybe, because that one, a late equaliser, should have been disallowed in the view of their linesman.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A point for each then. Not really enough for either to put a little daylight between themselves and the 3 teams at the foot of the table but better than nothing.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The 36th and 37th players used by YCAC1 since the summer were both 10th graders and had received the call up on saturday night. If you need players late on saturday night you have to call 16 year olds as you cant get any sense out of anyone else after&nbsp;10.30.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Our squad of 13 comprised&nbsp;4 teenagers, 6&nbsp;not very big Japanese and 3, 6 footers. Of the 3, 2 were legless, giggling and talking shorthand, and the other elderly and infirm. In short, if you'll pardon the pun,&nbsp;we were no match for the Celts physically, especially&nbsp;in the air. This was an issue in the 1H&nbsp;as the Celts bombarded the thin grey line with the wind at their backs. Much consternation in the YCAC penalty area resulting from Celts flick ons&nbsp;came to nought though as Keeper Kouka swept admirably&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The home teams cause was aided considerably though by the premature departure of Henry through injury and it looked like we would get to HT safely at 0-0. 5 minutes to go though a Celts corner was seemingly hit too far from goal and drifted harmlessly across the penalty area behind most of the attackers. It fell though to a lurking Celts midfielder who smashed it back across the face of the goal left footed all along the ground. It cannoned off the far post and in for the opening goal. From that distance and from that angle it needed to be a perfect strike to go in and it was and it did, so there.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As previously intimated the YCACs pint sized attack managed to fashion itself golden opportunities at a fairly consistent rate throughout the match. Both Mikey Taw and Mikey Kaneko missed comfortable chances to be able to claim that they scored a 1st TML1 goal before owning a razor and Adam Sjostedt showed he is a classic&nbsp;YCAC forward in the making by scattering the punters in the Breezeway Bar from a chance inside the 6yd box.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										More followed in the 2H as YCACs Hide 1st hit the post when clean through and then dinked another 1 on 1 chance over the GK only to be robbed by an extremely improbable goaline clearance. The chap slid underneath the bouncing ball and overhead kicked it out via the underside of the crossbar. I'm still to be convinced thats possible without the ball having crossed the line but hats off to the defender anyway.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Not to be denied in the end though YCAC finally got a scrambled equalizer after the Celts failed to clear their lines from a corner. The linesman flagged that the ball had left the field of play earlier in the move.&nbsp;The ball was on the other side of the goal from where the Linesman was and the Ref said he was closer so allowed the goal. I'm sure the Linesman thought he was correct but Refs overrule them all the time, right?<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Right. 1-1 then and nobody's happy<br>
