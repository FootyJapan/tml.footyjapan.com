									<p><b>YCAC Sunday 9th March</b>,<br>
										After a big win the previous week, our game against Albion provided a good reality check and re-inforced Managements wise decision to focus on the Cup this season!&nbsp; The previous match between the two clubs ended in a 0-1 defeat for YCAC2nds, I wasn't there but heard that it was a good contest that arguably we could have won.&nbsp; This time around lady luck seemed to be smiling on us, as the Albion clearly were missing a couple of players.&nbsp; Against which we spotted Hitoshi in goal and most teams know how hard it is to get the ball past him.&nbsp; We certainly had a lot more space to play in during the first half and the two-man advantage meant we were able to stretch play almost every time we had possession.&nbsp; The goal was well-worked when it came, Karl putting Simon through one-on-one with Hitoshi and converting very tidily.&nbsp; But in truth we could and should have done more damage in the first period.<br>
										<br>
										Second-half saw Albion back to full-strength, and therefore a much more even contest particular in midfield.&nbsp; Having said that, from our perspective we were disappointed with both goals conceded.&nbsp; It seemed that we&nbsp; spent whole periods camped in or near the oppo penalty area but were unable to sneak a second goal - numerous corners, a shot from Phil Denham which evaded Hitoshi but bounced back off the bar, another effort from Pete Fairbrother cleared off the line and a few games of pinball in the 6 yard box where anything could have happened.&nbsp; The Albion in contrast had 2 clear opportunities and converted both.&nbsp; C'est la vie.<br>
										<br>
										More important that the result, the game was an enjoyable contest.&nbsp; Not niggle-free, by any means, but never boiling over.&nbsp; Also some good sportsmanship on display from YCAC&nbsp; - I don't remember the last time I saw defenders admitting that the goal kick should actually be a corner and the ref (good old Werner) going along with it.&nbsp; I will have a word with the offenders, they better not do that again.&nbsp; Finally, respect to the Albion for their workrate&nbsp; - they are quick to close down and most of their players - George, Mick, Mark, Terry etc - never stop running, even when there are only 9 of them.&nbsp;<br>
