									<p><b>YCAC Sunday 16th March</b>,<br>
										Lions entered their 13th month undefeated in all 11-aside competitions, and&nbsp;with winning the last 10 TML games (including last season's finale), against a strong France team with 5 wins on the trot, this was destined to be match of the season.<br>
										France started strongly, and with Somi playing in an unorthodox central defence position (replacing the injured Sima), and the right- back Hussein looking very rusty after a 3 month spell on the sidelines with ligament damage, a 1-on-1 was incredibly diverted by the ever so reliable Orlando in goal.<br>
										Late Lions arrivals helped elevate the pressure, with Somi slotting back in midfield, Fahad replacing an unwell and usually consistent Baghir, Khalil partnering Raouf in central defence, and Hideki moved into right-back, replacing Hussein.<br>
										Lions were still missing the tall Zuhair upfront for this game, and his absence was definitely felt, no disrespect to the hard working strikers, but Zuhair's height and strength are irreplaceable.<br>
										France's Nacer was orchestrating a few attacks, with the young and tall Dre breaking through, only to be halted by a resilient Lions defence outside the box, however, a hard shot from the edge of the box tested Orlando again.<br>
										France finished the first half stronger.<br>
										The second half saw Ken Hersche misfire from 8 yards out after Omar played a great through ball, but a few minutes later, Ken's goal bound shot was deflected wide off a defender.<br>
										The isolated Ahmed Gaafar worked hard, but was then replaced half way through the second half with Tatsuya, who's last game saw him score against France a few months back. Tatsuya could've been on the score sheet when Ken accelerated into the box, and instead of shooting, he selflessly laid the ball across to a dashing Tatsuya, with only heroics from the France keeper saving a definite goal. Tatsuya twisted his ankle, 5 minutes after being on and was replaced by Ahmed again.<br>
										A free-kick at the edge of the box for France saw Orlando divert the ball to a corner. As the cross came in, a France player accidentally kneed Orlando in the back, and with the pain the keeper was in, it was thought his season was over, but less than 10 minutes of stoppage was enough to get him back between the posts.<br>
										The last 10 minutes were breath taking with a scrap in the France box causing the ball to fall to Gaafar Somi on the edge of the box, only to see his brilliant shot ricocheting off the bar.<br>
										On the other end, Dre was on the end of a great ball, and as he teed up the shot from 7 yards out, and Orlando posing for the shot, Raouf must've dashed 15 metres in 1 second to fly in the way of harm and block what could've been a goal (or miraculous save; according to Orlando)!<br>
										A few yellow cards were inevitable with the amount of charge and pride both teams had, but it was still a great battle to watch, one of a few interesting goalless draws to watch, and surely, had either of Dre or Somi's goals went in, it would've been a steal!<br>
										Both keepers did well, and its true 'keepers win you games' (well avoid defeat in this case)<br>
										Great all round performance by both teams cancelling each other out, and hopefully this fixture next year will be in Div 1!<br>
										Man of the Match: Raouf Jibril, great commitment and a brilliant challenge at the end..&nbsp;<br>
