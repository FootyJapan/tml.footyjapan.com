									<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 22nd September</b>,<br>
										WOSZI LIKE?!<br>
										<br>
										None of us can pretend to pronounce Rouven's name correctly but the 'Boy Woszidlo' enhanced his growing reputation with a thumping late header to give BFC a 1-0 victory over Hibs, leaving the champions with a perfect nine points from three games this season.<br>
										<br>
										Hibs will feel hard done by perhaps after creating as many chances as BFC in a game that was tighter than a mouse's ear with some handbags thrown in for good measure.<br>
										<br>
										One second-half breakaway forced goalkeeper Jason Leonardis and his unfeasibly large gloves into a miracle save with BFC defenders caught snoozing on their deckchairs, handerchiefs on heads.<br>
										<br>
										At the other end, 'Mini Juice' Shawn hit the crossbar with a header while Carlos Aranda sent a couple of fierce long-range drives narrowly wide.<br>
										<br>
										LIFE ON MARS<br>
										<br>
										Chances were at a premium and a lunar surface of a pitch hardly helped. Hard to make omelettes on a pancake like Oi Futo. The sunshine came out to play too. It was as welcome as a fart in a phone box.<br>
										<br>
										Ex-BFC player Tomo Kunii caused the odd panic attack down the right but Garry 'The Fish' Roberston, Brian 'The Engine' Doyle and Leigh 'The Hairdo' Manson were largely in control, that moment of madness that sparked their American goal-tender into action notwithstanding.<br>
										<br>
										Robertson went closest in the first half with a stinging drive that whistled past the post, while BFC struggled again with their delivery despite working the ball into promising areas. Most chances came from mystery free kicks given by a referee who was at least consistent in getting his decisions mixed up.<br>
										<br>
										ROW Z<br>
										<br>
										Shosuke Yamagishi, using the extra speed gleened from shaving off ALL of his body hair, wriggled himself into position to deliver once or twice but solid Hibs defending averted the danger. Sho brought his latest bird along. Fit as a butcher's dog she was too, bless him.<br>
										<br>
										I'll be honest. It was really hot and I remember little. It was a defender's game. It can only be thus on that pitch. All teams need to get out and look for decent astro pitches because the improving level of the TML deserves it.<br>
										<br>
										There were one or two meaty tackles and a bit of 'afters' that were soon forgotten. Rou's goal, though, was pure class. Robertson's first corner was scrambled back behind by Hibs but the second arrowed in to the danger zone and Rou powered home an unstoppable header.<br>
										<br>
										What goes around comes around maybe. Hibs might have put the ball out of play when a BFC player went down under a nasty foot-up tackle, which the referee remarkably deemed legal. They chose not to. Under the letter of the law in the professional game, you don't have to kick the ball out. In the TML ...<br>
