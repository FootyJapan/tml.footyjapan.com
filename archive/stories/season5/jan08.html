					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 27th January</b>,<br>
						Oh, but we just have to make it exciting don&rsquo;t we. Not enough for Sala the workman like three nil win. Not on your life. Never has the old adage of &lsquo;Two up and praying for a draw&rsquo; been more appropriate.<br>
						Three nil up and coasting with ten minutes left, Sala handed Jets two goals and had to endure a nervy final few minutes on Sunday night in Saitama. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0127sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						After a pretty strong season by Clash standards in 2006/2007 things this season have not been so good. Ok, we have been spanked more times than a cute high school girl has been by an ero-oyaji with cash to burn.<br>
						<br>
						A change of formations though has brought a bit more cohesion to the team and that paid dividends against KGFC on the 20th January with a 3-0 victory.<br>

						After a gentle warm up and some stretches it was time to have a bit of a chat about the day's formation, tactics and attitude. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0120wsc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Perhaps we should just skip past the 1st 40 minutes of this one. It was pretty ugly especially for both sets of defenders who collectively seemed to lack the inclination to deal with any Incoming whether on the ground or in the air. I dont know why. It was bright and the pitch was hard and uneven, but no worse than normal, and the often gusting hilltop winds were mercifully missing.&#x2026; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0120ycac.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						WS Clash were unlucky to lineup against a very strong Lions squad, similar to the squad that beat Maritizio 5-0. With some of the players having not played for 3-4 weeks, my personal expectations were 3-0, but a beautiful cross from Ahmed in the first 2 minutes that ended up in the back of the net from Ken's header from close range, made me think more?<br>
						BUT, celebrations were cut short when to everyone's amazement, the referee ruled out the goal for a foul on the keeper, who could'nt believe his luck <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0112lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Despite conditions so early and cold it even had the British players shivering in their footie boots, the Panthers initially attacked the game with surprising pace. Facing the wind we were forced into shorter goal kicks than we are used to from Tomo and that put the midfield and defense slightly on the back foot. We didn&rsquo;t let this get to us though and made a few attempts to sneak the ball up the wings with some delightful one touch passing, the Panthers manager and captain had finally come to realise all his shouting had not been in vain (a prospect he had been dreaming about fondly since the start of the season), but YCAC were not taking this laying down and defending well.

						Have you ever had the impression that the league is so far behind in the fixtures that whatever the conditions, you&rsquo;re playing? Well, that was the general consensus between the Geckoes and Embassy players as they took to the soaking dirt pitch at Oi on Saturday afternoon.<br>
						Sid had called earlier in the day to confirm that the game was indeed on (despite pools of water across the pitch) and from kick off it was apparent that most of the Geckoes players would rather have been elsewhere as it was the Embassy who made much of the early running. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0112wsg.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
