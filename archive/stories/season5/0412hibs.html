									<p><b>Hodogaya Koen Saturday 12th April</b>,<br>
										The Swiss always give Hibs a tough time, and it was no different Saturday. They had assembled a team with size and skill for the occasion, and the game was played at a high pace and level throughout.<br>
										<br>
										The Satoshi-Naoki-Yasu triumvirate got a hold of the midfield and we dominated the early going with great passing all along the pitch. Tomo had a great stretch as well and eventually got in one-on-one, but couldn't quite chip it over their keeper. Hibs had a number of great build-ups, but Kirk as always loomed large on defense for Swiss and we had few clear chances.<br>
										<br>
										We slowed down midway through the half and they began to catch us on the counter, leading to a few tight moments. Once their forward flicked a ball over Jay's head at the back but his shot was easily handled by Hitoshi, and on another play Josh went for the one-man offsides trap on the weak side and pulled it off, though their man headed the ball in the net before the call.<br>
										<br>
										In the second half we poured on the pressure, with Mick and Ike steadying the midfield, and the chances kept coming but we were unable to convert. Romen, in his debut, had one of the best chances on the goal line but couldn't knock it in. Then Kenji came on in defense, got the ball about 30 yards out and blasted a line drive which left the keeper no chance but ricocheted down off the cross bar. Yama, who as usual outran everyone on the pitch, dived in to score the rebound, 1-0 Hibs for a well-earned victory.<br>
										<br>
										I understand this was our last game against Kirk - we've had some battles over the years and I've cursed him before/during/after many games, but his quality and love of the game will be missed in Tokyo - good luck Captain.<br>
