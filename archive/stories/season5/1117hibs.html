									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 17th November</b>,<br>
										The Hibs' glut of games at oft-canceled Misato this year meant this was our first match in four weeks. We showed up with bare 11 and not sure what to expect from BEFC.<br>
										<br>
										We came out strong and locked them in their half, we had multiple forays behind their defense only to be stymied by tough last-ditch defending and the bumpy pitch. The Hibs won several corners and got good service from Tomo and Mike but headed wide on multiple occasions. Then as the half wore on and we failed to capitalize, BEFC began to gain confidence and had a few offensive runs.<br>
										<br>
										Hibs striker Andre was visibly frustrated by our inability to get any decent service to him in the middle - but eventually quality finds a way, and he collected a pass wide left from Mike, beat his man and got into the box where he was tripped up for the PK. He calmly blasted it home, 1-0 into halftime.<br>
										<br>
										We came out much stronger in the second and the game got a bit testy, a torrent of unprintables filled the air but that was as far as things got. Hibs continued to create chances and Andre struck again off a corner from Tomo, powering in near post to head home, 2-0. Mike then converted a nice drive off a free kick from the right side for 3-0.<br>
										<br>
										The Hibs relaxed and BEFC began to catch us at the back, eventually a midfielder broke through on the left to draw the defense, then sent a nice cross over to be smashed home at close range, 3-1. That woke us up again and we got our final goal when Mike whacked a shot in from the left that their keeper could only parry to Tomo, who booted home from close range, 4-1.<br>
										<br>
										A fair result as the Hibs continue to work in our newer players. The ref caught a lot of gab during the game, but I thought he called it very fair - he did a good job at keeping tempers from boiling over, and also in ignoring bogus offsides calls from linesmen.<br>
