									<p><b>YCAC Sunday 17th Feb</b>,<br>
										The Embassy arrived at YC &amp; AC in confident mood, and knowing that a point would move them out of the relegation places for the first time this season. That was reflected in an encouraging start; shifting the ball around nicely in midfield and mopping up loose balls at the back effectively. Hal was probing from midfield and Alex and Crouchy were linking up well. However, they were shaken when YC&amp;AC attacked down the left and sent an inviting cross over for 23 to tower above Rob and plant his header firmly into the corner. Like in the last game against Hibs, the goal spurred on the Embassy and they came close to equalizing before the break. Yuya was a constant threat, and at the end of a run past three defenders, he rounded the keeper, but the angle was too tight, and the ball came back off the post.<br>
											After some changes at half-time, the pressure continued on the YC&amp;AC defence, but the Embassy were dealt a blow, when after Hal and Rob limping off with minor knocks, Crouchy was sent tumbling in a heavy challenge, and he too had to go off. On came Eddie, and he and Sil put together some nice moves, but couldn&rsquo;t test the keeper. A long range effort from Yuya did though, and the keeper did well to tip it over for a corner. YC&amp;AC were always dangerous on the break, with the midfield pushing forward, and the strikers interchanging from side to side, but that said, Taka rarely had a save to make as Gary, Mark, Lou and Tim defended stoutly. With little over ten minutes remaining, the Embassy got a free-kick to the right of the penalty area, and when most were expecting Ferdy to put in a cross, he cheekily chipped the ball over the wall and inside the near post. The Embassy cheered, but those celebrations weren&rsquo;t to last long, as with time running out, the ref awarded a controversial free-kick on the edge of the Embassy area, with Taka adjudged to have handled outside. By the smallest of margins are games won and lost, and when the cross came over, there was an air of inevitability when 23 rose again and headed home the winner. A cruel blow to the Embassy, who battled hard all afternoon, but on this form, it is surely only a matter of time until they move away from the drop zone.<br>
										<br>
										Man of the Match: Yuya &#150; full of running, some excellent deliveries and his driving runs deserved better<br>
