									<p><b>Hachioji Koen, Sunday 8th June</b>,<br>
										Lions seemed to let their gaurd down after winning the Division 2 title and securing promotion a few weeks back, and complacency is evident in their current form of 1 win in 5!<br>
										With the super keeper&nbsp;Orlando missing the 3rd game in a row, his 3 goals conceded over 12 games surely looks even more impressive after Lions leaked 8 goals in the last 3 games.<br>
										Other absentees included the inform Fahad, Khalil, and Tatsuya.<br>
										Lions welcomed back Zuhair, who prior to this clash was never on a losing Lions side this season, but the tall striker didn't kick a ball for over 5 weeks, and looked short on fitness.<br>
										Sima shook off his 5 week layoff from a hamstring but to expect a full game from the 37-year old was a tall order.<br>
										Captain Somi was back, but he was unable to shake off his foot injury that kept him out in recent weeks, and after a few minutes, he was forced off.<br>
										The talented AbuBakr, the play-maker for Lions, found himself chasing after a Maritizio player 5 minutes into the game, when an offside trap failed, but as the player crossed infront of Abu, the legs tangled, and as the players came to ground about 20 or so yards out, a foul was awarded, and a harsh straight red to Abu, saw Lions go down to 10, to add insult to injury. (Editor note* If the last player fouls a striker through on goal, Ref has no choice but give a red card*)<br>
										Maritizio went ahead on 10 minutes.<br>
										Rafai&nbsp;then had a great run across the box and his low hit shot deflected off the post and agonisingly across the goal to Omar who hit a fierce near post shot, only to be denied by the keeper.<br>
										Ken Hersche equalised for Lions with a well taken shot. 5 minutes later, Rafai (aka Eddy) picked up the ball from his own half and accelerated past 2 or 3 defenders, all the way to 7 yards out to coolly slot past the desparate keeper, to make it  2-1 to Lions.<br>
										A few minutes later, he had another shot hit the post.<br>
										Ken was through, and as a similar incident that got Abu sent off, Ken went to ground in the box, and as Lions expected a penalty and a sending off but the ref waved it away.<br>
										Rafai&nbsp;was also through again, and a heroic block from Henry saw the ball deflect to a corner, but surprisingly given as a goal-kick by the ref.<br>
										<br>
										In the second half,&nbsp;Rafai put Zuhair through and as the keeper came out, the shot deflected off the keeper to safety.<br>
										The linesman on the Martizio side waved Hideki on the nearside as Offside, and as the ref stopped the game, and Lions protestors asked the linesman, he said Ken was offside on the farside?! When the non-interfering rule was mentioned, the linesman claimed he never heard of such a rule?!<br>
										<br>
										Lions got only 1 foul throughout the game...and after Maritizio drew, shouts to stop the game to take off the limping Sima were ignored as Maritizio dashed through, and past the player in agony to score their third.<br>
										A couple of long shots bounced just before the keeper into the net to give Maritizio an undeserved flattering scoreline.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Maritizio were ranting to Lions to prepare to Division 1 as half the Maritizio players are borrowed from Division 1. It was amazing how Maritizio had such a short-term memory, after their exact line-up had a&nbsp;5-0 drubbing by Lions, when Lions had their full squad.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Lions still have a game to go, and they will HAVE TO finish it on a high.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Meanwhile, Maritizio are a sitting duck in 2nd place for a highly talented France who scored 17 goals in their last 3 games, and only need a 1-0 win over Jetro to secure their promotion to Division 1 where they usually reside, deservedly so.<br>
