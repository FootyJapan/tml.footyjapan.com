									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 21st October</b>, <br>
										The Hibs were caught off guard before the game by the green stuff all over the YCAC pitch, but it turned out be grass - our first of the season, natural or otherwise. We also had perfect weather and new kit, and the still bitter memory of the 3-0 whipping YCAC laughingly gave us last season.<br>
										<br>
										 From the kickoff it looked to be a repeat, YCAC had us on our heels immediately. We couldn't catch up to them in the midfield or get anything going up front, and it was only a strong showing from our back four that kept us in the game. Hibs keeper Hitoshi was forced off his line several times to punch crosses away, and we began to bunker down in our own half. Naoki also gave us a big hand on defense.<br>
										<br>
										Then at about the 20 minute mark their ace midfielder got free outside the 18 and ripped a shot to the left post. Hitoshi was caught wrong-footed but somehow managed to recover, dive right and deflect it with his left thumb - absurd save, you kind of had to be there. He needed a few minutes after that to put his thumb back in its socket, but the play woke us up, and from there it was all Hibs.<br>
										<br>
										We got some balls through to Tomo on the wide right and he took advantage with long runs down the wing for crosses and shots. Eventually he beat his man and whipped a long ball across the goal - Ed knocked it down for Andre who blasted it through a YCAC defender for the goal, 1-0 Hibs. We built momentum, and Yasu chipped over the defense to Tomo, who took it straight into the box and fired home, 2-0 into half time.<br>
										<br>
										In the second half YCAC pressed forward in numbers and created a few forays into the box but the Hibs defense kept them from any shots on goal. They left themselves exposed at the back and we began to catch them on the counter -  Ed and Andre created several chances but failed to convert, and the YCAC keeper also made some good saves. Eventually Jay cleared a ball up the line to Andre, who put Tomo through for another goal to make it 3-0. Then Andre, who ran all game and didn't seem to tire, picked off a pass and went in to score for the 4-0 final.<br>
										<br>
										The game was hard fought throughout and got a bit chippy, and the ref did well to keep things under control. A fair result - YCAC could've scored, but we could've had a few more as well.<br>
										<br>
										Men of the match - I can't think of anyone that had a bad game, the defense was great and Hitoshi had the magic save. But I have to go with Tomo and Andre and their 4 goals. Tomo was lethal on the right side, and Andre was dominant up front.<br>
