									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 9th February</b>,<br>
										Forget about the Premiership, Seria A, Champions League...etc....If you want to watch the most flowing football nowadays, you should watch Lions playing!<br>
										Lions have now completed the first half of the season with a perfect record (well, almost...conceded 1 goal), by beating every team in Division 2 an average score of 3-0, and topping the tables, with 5 of their players in the top scorers, Ken Hersche being joint top scorer on 7 goals. Lions have also been booked only a couple of times &#150; Fairplay team.<br>
										Lions were missing 4 or 5 regular players, but a make shift team with only 2 subs, controlled the game against a stubborn Barbarians team.<br>
										Ken scored the opening goal 3 minutes after crashing his penalty against the bar, after Gaafar Somi dribbled past three players and was brought down by a clumsy challenge. Zuhair got on the end of a long ball to finish acrobatically, to score Lions&rsquo; second and his 5th of the season.<br>
										The frustrated young Ahmed Gaafar was brought off the bench in the second half, only to slot calmly, all credit to the referee for allowing play to go on after the linesman unjustifiably flagged Ahmed offside.<br>
										Ahmed then skimmed past the aging legs of Fred, only to see his chip agonisingly go past the wrong side of the bar. He could&rsquo;ve had his hat-trick when a soft shot fell easily to Fred &#150; now in goal.<br>
										Barbarians had 1 or 2 rare attacks, and although 1 attack was a bit dangerous, Lions controlled the pace of the game and could&rsquo;ve easily made it 4, 5 or 6 on a slightly sharper day for the strikers, evident from AbuBakr&rsquo;s dribbling past 3 players on the left and with the keeper charging and Somi infront of a gaping goal, Abu went for goal, hitting the outside of the side-netting.<br>
										Excellent performance by Lions yet again.<br>
										Man of the Match: Gaafar Somi, determined to beat his old team, dictated the game from midfield.<br>
