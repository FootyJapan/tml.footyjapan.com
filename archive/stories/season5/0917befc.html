									<p><b>Fuchu No Mori Monday 17tth September</b>,<br>
										In the baking Fuchu sun the British Embassy and the BFC Vagabonds&nbsp;played out a hard-fought contest which was vastly more entertaining than any Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan rom-com. But then what isn't?<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Narrow defeat leaves the Embassy still searching for&nbsp;its first point of the new season, but with regular players&nbsp;to return&nbsp;and a good team effort here, there&nbsp;are plenty of&nbsp;reasons to believe&nbsp;the results will come. The game was tight throughout, and one goal was always likely to be enough. That goal came mid-way through the second half when the Embassy defence was sprung and the young Vagabonds striker took the ball wide of the keeper -&nbsp;too wide maybe? - no, a&nbsp;cool finish&nbsp;giving his side what turned out to be&nbsp;a decisive advantage.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The match had started with the Embassy defence looking as if it had never played together - because it hadn't. Makeshift centre-halves Rob Horsefield and Eddie Peters had a couple of early scares, but after ten minutes or so both settled well into their new roles, winning most of the important headers and tackles. Will Ryan and new captain Fernando Bermudez were their&nbsp;usual selves in the middle of the park, winning the ball and feeding the strikers, Steve &quot;Crouch&quot; Lidbury and Silvano Borroni -&nbsp;both of whom caused problems for the Vagabonds without quite carving out any clear shooting opportunities. Crouchie created the best chance of the first half, making space out right and putting over a great cross, which Satoshi Kono put narrowly past the post. Alex Babulall had some good runs, but while no quartet of Beckenbauers the opposition defence did their jobs and gave nothing for free. The Vagabonds had the odd chance in the first 40 minutes  too and even hit the post in the opening minutes, but like the Embassy couldn't convert. Then just before half-time disaster for the Embassy, with skipper Ferdy limping off not to return to the field of play.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										If the Embassy had shaded the first half, Vagabonds were the better side in the second against the Embassy's now Ferdy-less line-up. The defence&nbsp;held firm,&nbsp;including&nbsp;when Will slotted in at the back for a spell, and Keith Crowley was solid in goal and kicked well. But Vags looked like the likelier scorers, and so&nbsp;it proved with 20 minutes to go. The Embassy responded, and Crouchie made the space for a shot but hit it too close to the keeper. League debutant Hal Parker looking lively and almost scored. Fit, fast, skillful and still in his 20s, &quot;I have seen the future and it works&quot;. (WARNING: this phrase was first used about the Soviet Union in the 1920s - let's hope things work out a little better with Hal). The other debutant Andy Ellis added some needed solidity in the second half, but the Embassy was crying out for&nbsp;a moment of magic and no one was able to provide one. In fact it could have been 2-0, the Embassy caught out chasing the game and a one-on-one foiled only by Keith &quot;inadvertently&quot; handling outside the box and receiving a yellow card.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Still plenty of time for the Embassy to turn this campaign around. But it needs to happen soon.<br>
