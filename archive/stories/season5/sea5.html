									BFC`s recruiting foray into the international school system has paid dividends as the TML champions celebrated their second successive title by putting third placed Sala to the sword on Saturday, thanks largely to the quality of their teenage strike force.<br>

									The contest didn`t quite have the usual sense of anticipation that usually accompanies this fixture. Newly crowned champions BFC were coming off an inexplicable thumping at the hands of the Hibs in the cup final whilst Sala had succumbed 2-1 to the same opposition a week prior thanks in no small part to the genetically engineered &ldquo;Mini Hitoshi&rdquo; who thwarted attack after Sala attack with his bionic limbs. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0607sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Over the last few weeks it's been snow that caused havoc with the fixtures so it was very frustrating when more matches were cancelled last Sunday on a clear Sunny day. Although the sun was shining, 100km/h winds forced the Musashino train line (and others) to stop, stranding players all across Saitama. Those who went by car to the Misato pitch, soon realized even if they did have a full squad, football was out of the question.<br>
									Watching local kids trying to have a kick around, the ball was going a couple of yards in one direction, then doing a U-turn and being blown 50~100 yards in the other. Any match would have been a farse, with morse time being spent chasing stray balls (although that's nothing new with some teams ;-)) Hopefully, with the help of captains, we can catch up all cancelled games to finish the season on time.<br>

									Swiss vs. Jets on Saturday, great day for a match at Oifuto as the pitch appeared to have been unused following the light rain on Friday evening.&nbsp; Other than the strange &quot;circle&quot; in midfield which even caused the referee to reprimand encroachers for being aggressive, the smooth surface at Dai 1 is typically a joy to play on.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this writer's age is becoming more of a problem as covering the expansive pitch at Oifuto has me begging for 5 a side on Thursday nights. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/1201swiss.html" target="_blank">more from Swiss...</a><br>

									The pitch, which was being used for the first time since being completely flooded during the last big typhoon, had a hard crust, but was slick with mud underneath which would barely take a stud. Not the best news for Ronald, who had turned up wearing trainers.<br>

Eyes large as marmosets, we watched the game more than we played it in the early first half. Ged was on edge, shouting his head off. Richard pensive on the line.

Git.

Goals from 17 year old Shawn on his debut, a clinical penalty by Carlos and a fine individual goal from another debutant, Jerry, saw off the Embassy in the season opener for both teams.<br>
									Lining up with Jason in goal, Leigh, James Mulligan, Brian and Ryo in defence, BFC was determined to keep tight at the back - a cornerstone of their success from last year. Pablo and Carlos worked the center of midfield putting in a huge effort, and with Shosuke and Garry starting on the wings there was plenty of creativity on display. Up front, a very young and talented forward line of Dan and Sean sought to unsettle the Embassy backline with their pace and ability on the ball. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0901bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

These new teams are joining with the lower half of last years Div 2 to form the new Division 3. All teams will now play the other teams in their division twice. Divisions 2&amp;3 have been limited to 8 teams as even this will put a huge strain on resources (grounds). Unfortunately 6 teams had to be turned away from joining the league, although we hope to be able to allow them to play in the future.<br>
									The season will Kick off on Sat 25th August and run through till June next year all going well, but all players &amp; supporters are urged to help their team captains &amp; TML by supplying necessary documents to help in the booking of grounds, otherwise we may become known as the Misato Metropolis League!!<br>
