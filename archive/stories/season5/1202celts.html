									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 2nd</b>,<br>
										Same opposition two weeks running, was almost like a home and away tie. Both teams seemed to have changes from the previous week due to injuries, hangovers and lads just not bothering to get out to Misato at another unearthly hour. Celts didn't get a full warm up due to the bizarre patterns of traffic in Tokyo's outer-rims,  it was like spurs defence, didn't move for about 30 minutes and then suddenly opened up to allow anyone through.<br>
										Arriving as Jorge was dishing out final warnings the team ran out onto the pitch with no time for managerial instructions, probably a bonus for all. The effect of no warm up was clear to see as Vagabonds started eagerly creating a few opportunities among the still dozing Celts defence. However, before myself and Sam could shout enough expletives to awaken the slumber we were 1 up with our first attack. Good play down the right between Masa and Jonahsy allowed Vince to pass the ball into Mel who shot across the keeper. <br>
										Mel prolific Smith wishes we were playing the same opposition every week with two goals in two games against the same keeper. This allowed the Celts to get a foothold on the game and almost scored shortly after when Hide had a close effort cleared off the line. The only concern for Celts was coming from Reeder's groin, <b>scary thought</b>! <br>
										Our dash from traffic to pitch resulted in Ben having to go off at half time injured. It was either that or receive some treatment and neither myself or Sam wanted to play physio to that injury. However, with one centre half already sidelined, another pulled out due to bench pressing commitments we were down to the bare bones and relied on an early January transfer to acquire the necessary defender.<br>
										<br>
										The second half was pretty uneventful until Toru scored a majestic goal from just inside the opposition half when he 'saw' the keeper off his line. By this time next week Toru will have been in his own half when he scored. It was a delightful goal and allowed the Celts to see out the game. Not likely! The last 4 minutes of injury time saw more goal attempts from Vagabonds than the previous 80. They rattled the framework of the Celts goal twice in 30 seconds and due to an unfortunate clash of heads also had a man rattled. Thankfully, Misatos' finest medical service arrived to ask in medical parlance 'Daijobu?<br>
										Thanks to Jorge for a very professional performance and to the Vagabonds lads for a game played in good spirits. From a Celt's perspective good games from Hide, Masa and Dermeto Carlos at left back.<br>
