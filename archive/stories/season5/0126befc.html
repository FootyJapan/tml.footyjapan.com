									<p><b>Hodogaya Koen, Saturday 26th Jan</b>,<br>
										Few would have given the Embassy much hope yesterday of a result against top-of-the-table Hibs. However, the high level of commitment, which has never been in doubt, was finally rewarded with a result &#150; a 2-2 draw in an entertaining affair in Hodogaya. It looked bleak though early on, when after only a few minutes Hibs were given a penalty, despite Mark appearing to take at least some of the ball in the tackle. The penalty was well struck but Taka guessed right and the save galvanized the Embassy who scored a few minutes later.<br>
										 A brilliant pin-point cross from Yuya found Crouchie, who did justice to the name on the back of his shirt, with a towering header giving the keeper no chance. Hibs came back though and when the tricky right winger got in front of Rob in the box and went down, the ref gave Hibs a second penalty. Again, Taka guessed right, only this time Hibs followed up and slotted home the rebound. The Embassy rallied again and after some fine build up play, Yuya rifled home from the edge of the area to give the Embassy a deserved 2-1 half-time lead. <br>
											The second-half though was a different story as Hibs came out passing neatly and overlapping down the flanks to keep the Embassy on the back foot. That said, they were mainly restricted to long-range efforts, one of which was athletically tipped over by Taka. The Embassy defended set-pieces well, and Gary and Mark kept the leagues leading marksman relatively quiet. Ferdy, Taka Y and Will were all biting in the tackles, and the Hibs were growing increasingly frustrated. Indeed, it could have been even worse for them as the Embassy countered with Alex almost getting through after a good run, and Crouch thumping one over the bar as the front two, well-supported by Tetsu and Yuya, caused the Hibs defence a few uneasy second-half moments. It looked as though the Embassy were going to hang on for a much needed three points but with around five minutes to go, another long range effort sneaked inside Taka&rsquo;s left hand post and gave the Hibs a share of the spoils. All in all, a draw was probably about right and leaves both sides with much to play for in the rest of the season. <br>
