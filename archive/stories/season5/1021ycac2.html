									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 21st October</b>,<br>
										Somewhat later than the rest of the League, YCAC2's finally got their 07/08 TML season underway against Shane at the YCAC.&nbsp; Although we had done a bit of pre-season, we are not normally strong starters and were keen to make an exception this year.&nbsp; The team had a new look to it (and not only because of the nifty&nbsp;new grey strip).&nbsp; We welcomed back some old boys,&nbsp;some new&nbsp;faces&nbsp;(Nigel, Nick, Harty and&nbsp;Mikey)&nbsp;and were missing a few&nbsp;due to RWC and&nbsp;holidays.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Unfortunately Shane appear to be having trouble getting enough players out this year, and with the exception of a brief period after half-time when they borrowed some of the waiting Hibs players, they played most of this game with 9.&nbsp; Still, that in itself was no guarantee of success - as&nbsp;Steve Taw reminded me, we have&nbsp;managed to lose to teams&nbsp;with less than 11 players before.&nbsp; Anyway, we were 4-0 upfairly quickly, looked&nbsp;good going forward and generally&nbsp;passing well to take advantage of the spare players we had.&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-time was 4-1, full-time was double that.&nbsp; Credit to the Shane keeper who&nbsp;made a number of good stops at various times during the game to keep the score down.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										My man-of-the-match was Kaz, mainly because he scored 3 times (in 50 minutes)&nbsp;and you can't argue with that.&nbsp; But also very happy with&nbsp;strong contributions from all the debutants.&nbsp; So a good start but plenty of scope for improvement.<br>
