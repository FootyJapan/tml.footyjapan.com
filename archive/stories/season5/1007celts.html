									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 7th October</b>,<br>
										Kanto Celts kicked off their TML Season 5 campaign with a 2-2 draw with Saitama Jets at Misato.<br>
										The Celts were missing 7+ regular first team players; with injuries, business trips and the bank holiday weekend taking their toll, however the pre-season recruitment of several new players along with the assistance of friends and acquaintances meant we were able to field a team of 12 for our first game.<br>
										The game kicked off with the Celts unfamiliar line-up launching some early sorties into the Jets half, however within the first 10 minutes and against the run of play the Jet managed to get their opening goal thanks to a misunderstanding at the back and Roberto heading past the stranded Terry and into the back of the empty net.<br>
										Celts maintained the pressure after the restart and following good work in the middle park Vince won a free kick on the edge of the box on the right. Veteran defender Fred stepped up to launch a floated free kick into the area which was met by Masa whose downward header was directed into the bottom right hand side of the goal for Celts equaliser. The remainder of the first half was pretty even with both teams making good progress down the wings and thru the middle of the park, however it was Celts who managed to finish a move which saw the ball worked from the back, down the right wing and a another floated cross from Vince that was met by Toru to put Celts 2-1 up at halftime.<br>
										As the second half got underway it was obvious that because of the limited number of Celts, fatigue was showing and the Jets capitalised on this to push hard into the Celts half for the good part of 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; The pressure eventually paid off, however the goal came from a cross that was spilled into the path of the Jets player who made no mistake and netted the Jets equaliser.<br>
										The Celts rallied again and with the following 20 minutes managed several clear cut chances on the Jets goal that we were unable to finish, putting the ball either wide or over the Jet goal. With time running out, Celts got in behind the Jets defence and with Vince and Henry running onto goal with just the keeper to beat it seamed that Celts would secure the points, however a great save from the Jets keeper earned Jet&rsquo;s their point.<br>
										On the whole Jets were fortunate to come away with a point, Celts definitely had more clear cut chances and should have scored at least 2 or 3 goals in the second half.<br>
										For the Celts outstanding performances from everyone that played, the defence Terry, Chris, Fred, Kaneko &amp; Roberto were superb, despite two goals conceded, the middle of the park was a hive of activity with Masa, Henry, Toru, Ken and Hide all supporting the lone striker Vince and running back to cover defence. Final mention to JC, who despite being out till 6AM still managed to make the game and cover as super sub for some tiring legs.<br>
										A good enjoyable game, well refereed by Quinten.<br>
