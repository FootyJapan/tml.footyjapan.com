									<p><b>Hachioji Koen Saturday 3rd May</b>,<br>
										Sala kept their slim title hopes alive on Sunday evening at Hachioji with a 4-1 win over an under strength YCAC thanks in no small part to the fluffy head of Tobias Long.  <br>
										<br>
										YCAC arrived with the bare eleven, the rest of their squad perhaps taking advantage of the golden week break by sunning themselves on various beach resorts across the globe.  As a result a hint of complacency could be detected in the Sala ranks before kickoff and it was YCAC who began the better of the two sides, winning a series of corners and producing a couple of fine saves from Sid Lloyd who enjoyed one of his better games of the season.<br>
										<br>
										Sala&rsquo;s passing in the first half ranged anywhere between lackluster and atrocious with the exception of one speculative through ball that Shige Chino managed to run onto before expertly chipping the keeper only to see the ball float agonizingly over the bar.  His next effort, a stinging shot from the edge of the box, rattled off the crossbar.  YCAC weren&rsquo;t so lucky from the next corner.  Brooke-Smith, making his only contribution of the match, sent a cross deep to the far post for Toby Long to ghost in and head home from an acute angle.<br>
										<br>
										Brookey trotted back to the bench, his job done, to focus on the half time motivational talk.  More effort, quicker passing, more movement, harder tackling, better finishing, etcetera, etcetera.  It kind of worked as Sala started winning more possession and creating more chances.  Toby&rsquo;s long range effort sailed wide but Sala were soon 2-0 up after a Sam Mathews cross from the right side managed to elude keeper, striker and defenders and find its way to the head of the only man who could read the flight of the ball.  You guessed it, Toby Long.<br>
										<br>
										Two goals and a return to form for the striker but the game wasn&rsquo;t over yet.  A mazy run from YCAC&rsquo;s nimble Japanese striker saw him dart past the entire Sala defence and lash an unstoppable shot past Sid. Sid&rsquo;s excuse being that he didn&rsquo;t see it. A quality goal that gave Steve Taw&rsquo;s men a glimmer of hope.<br>
										<br>
										A few nervous moments followed for Sala.  Shots flashed across Sid&rsquo;s goal and balls were desperately cleared from the Sala box.  Ian &ldquo;the Bear&rdquo; Jelley received a caution from referee Quentin for some overzealous tackling but his tireless efforts ensured Sala remained in front.  After 70 minutes eventually YCAC ran out of legs and Sala finally started playing some decent football.  The hard running Guido Geisler put the nail in the coffin with a sizzling left foot shot from the edge of the box after some neat buildup play, Toby Long again involved.  And after trying his hardest to avoid getting on the scoresheet, Dhugal Bedingfield finally put one in the back of the net, albeit off the inside of the post, after Lenny Tui&rsquo;s powerful shot was parried by the keeper.<br>
										<br>
										4-1 was a rather flattering result for Sala.  Not the most convincing of performances but at this stage the three points are all that matters and anything other than another three points against Swiss this Saturday will hand the league to BFC for the second year in a row.  Wish us luck..<br>
