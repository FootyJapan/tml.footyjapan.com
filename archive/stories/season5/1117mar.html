									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 17th November</b>,<br>
										With&nbsp;4 key players out and several unusual positional changes Maritizio was in trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact moments in the game&nbsp;Maritizio had their French Goal Keeper Vince playing on field as Maritizio found itself running out of&nbsp;options and ammunition. But with Vince with a new sense of being did not embarass&nbsp;himself or the team. We hope to see that again!&nbsp;<br>
										From the start the faster and fitter Japanese players of Jetro showed why they were on top and favourite for a Div 1 promotion.<br>
										The&nbsp;Jetro players were very controlled, linked well, ran well, and very early on scored to make it 1-0. For the remaining larger part of the 1st half the Maritizio defense was under constant pressure. Vern marshalled the defence and they remarkably held out. The sustained pressure was held by the other defenders such as Roberto, who was playing out of position. Credit to Roberto who told me after the game that he was still carrying the ankle injury sustained some&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;ago from an overzealous Barbarians defender. He explained that he had a bad game. I never had noticed!<br>
										Ever reliable defenders Jun and Yasu continued to sustain the attack from the faster Japanese players. The midfielders continued to find themselves facing their own goal chasing the opposition attack. What was worse that&nbsp;Yasu and Lopes one after the other sustained injuries creating further migraine. Maurice, Tim, Phillip, Christ and Marco all found themselves running short marathons and struggled to keep up with the pace of the Japanese players who seemed to come from everywhere.<br>
										The whistle came and respite. <br>
										The Jetro team came off looking happy, and confident&nbsp;with their efforts. Maritizio looked like a line of Australians coming off the Kokoda trail in Papua all shot up, beaten and demoralized.<br>
										Half time&nbsp;soul searching&nbsp;with a look in to the abyss and a look back at our selves saw us rise and lift. Out for the second half, it began&nbsp;as it&nbsp;had started. The signs were there that Jetro was attempting to run over Maritizio lines and finish us off.<br>
										After game talk and&nbsp;banter found the words 'Will Power'.<br>
										Solid tackles, aggression, push through pain&nbsp;barriers&nbsp;and fight from all Maritizio players found the Jetro team begin to question their&nbsp;ability. It was a beautiful thing to see the shift and pressure Maritizio began lumping on to Jetro. Corner after corner and shots on goal saw the power of our players and it was finally a marvellous solid effort by Lopes&nbsp;who had came off earlier injured to come back on to&nbsp;equalize. Maritizio&nbsp;continued the pressure and showed courage under fire with Roberto making penetrating runs with several players looking to score,&nbsp;with Maurice firing away but only to miss. It began to darken and get colder for Jetro as the light dropped and Jetro players must of thought it was time to go home as the whistle blew for full time. Maritizio looks forward in the return fixture!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Maritizio players would like to wish Toby congratulations on the birth of&nbsp;his boy Enzo this week<br>
