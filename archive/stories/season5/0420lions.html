									<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunday 20th April</b>,<br>
										A very windy day in YCAC saw WS Clash playing for Div 2 survival against a tough and determined Lions outfit. Lions had a debutant ex-pro keeper, Hisham, replacing the absent Orlando. Hisham looked sharp in warm-up, but the only time he as called into action was to pick up the ball from the net after Sid capitalised on a defensive error from Lions, and his pinpoint cross was met at the near post with a powerful header by Masa Hanamura, making it the first goal Clash have scored against Lions.<br>
										Lions were unlucky not to go ahead after 2 minutes when Zuhair chipped the keeper from the edge of the box, only to see the wind blow the ball away from goal and onto the post. Ken and Omar were through twice, only to shoot the ball wide.<br>
										The first half finished 1-0 to WS Clash.<br>
										10 minutes into the second half, Ken was swapped for Ahmed, and the usually inspirational Omar was substituted for the giant Gassim to help in this physical &lsquo;Clash&rsquo;.<br>
										Fahad was trying hard, playing in an unorthodox centre-back position with Raoof missing. A beautiful lobbed ball from the battling Baghir saw Somi break into the box and volley the bal from 5 yards out to level the score.<br>
										5 minutes later, Gassim and Zuhair used their bodies well and as Zuhair broke into the box and with the keepr rushing out, he selflessly laid the ball across to a dashing Somi who unleashed a scorcher that deflected off the bar and into the net to make it 2-1 to Lions.<br>
										Gassim and Ahmed were then swapped later on for Ken and Hussein, when Ken sprinted on the right flank and crossed in a beauty that went behind Zuhair but fell to Hussein who although had time, he took it on the volley, but the attempt was tame and fell nicely for the keeper.<br>
										A minute later, the Clash keeper made a good save from Ken&rsquo;s shot after a scrap in the box.<br>
										With 30 seconds to go, Somi picked the ball in midfield and ran through and as he passed the ball around a Clash defender, the defender stopped and shouted for offside, but to his dissappointment, Somi carried his run through, and into the box, and with 4 Lions against the keeper, Somi slotted his 3rd and first hat-trick for Lions.<br>
										Now Lions have 6 players in the top 10 scorers in Div 2 (Somi now on 6), and Lions need 1 more win over Barbarians next weekend to clinch a promotion spot, with needing a further 1 point after that to become Div2 Champions.<br>
										Needless to say, Man of the Match: Gaafar Somi<br>
