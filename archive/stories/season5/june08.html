						350 or so of the Footy Japan faithful descended upon Legends Sports Bar in Roppongi (www.legendsports.jp/eng/eng.html) to celebrate, congratulate, intoxicate, commiserate and generally congregate to bid farewell to the Tokyo Metropolis League's 5th season.<br>

						The award ceremony this year was not quite as disgraceful as last year's with the majority of acceptance speeches being kept short and devoid of profanity or sabre rattling. We'll be sure to delay the ceremony by an hour or so next year to give everyone time to get utterly leathered, lose all inhibitions and talk utter bollox when they collect their trophies - come on, we're footballers for god sake - it's not the bloody Oscars... <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0627eosp.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>ALT East Japan tournament. Sugadaira, Nagano, Weeked 14th &amp; 15th June</b>,<br>
						TML teams led the way at the ALT tournament on the beautiful grass pitches of Sugadaira this past weekend. The Final was an encounter between division 1's Kanto Celts &amp; Sala (aka Chiba Libra).<br>

						It was once again Henry Monohan who took the honours for the Celts, scoring the only goal in a tight final. This is the 2nd piece of silverware this year for the Celts, following their victory at the Charity 6's erlier in the year. Other TML teams also participated inc. BEFC, JETS &amp; a mixture of Hibs &amp; Geckoes. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0615alt.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>ASIJ, Saturday 7th June</b>,<br>
						BFC`s recruiting foray into the international school system has paid dividends as the TML champions celebrated their second successive title by putting third placed Sala to the sword on Saturday, thanks largely to the quality of their teenage strike force.<br>
						<br>
						The contest didn`t quite have the usual sense of anticipation that usually accompanies this fixture. Newly crowned champions BFC were coming off an inexplicable thumping at the hands of the Hibs in the cup final whilst Sala had succumbed 2-1 to the same opposition a week prior thanks in no small part to the genetically engineered &ldquo;Mini Hitoshi&rdquo; who thwarted attack after Sala attack with his bionic limbs. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0607sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 15th June</b>,<br>
						Captain Kirk Neureiter ended his footballing career in Japan probably in the same fashion as he started it, marshalling his side to a controlled and efficient victory over a team at least as good as his own individually but overmatched mentally and as a unit.&nbsp;<br>
						Rumour has it that Kirk actually started here with the BFC but of course hes known as the face of the Swiss who, with the Hibs, dominated the 1st 3 years of the TML. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0615ycac.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 15th June</b>,<br>
						After draining all the energy and resources early on in the season with 10 back to back wins, Lions small but talented and growing squad held off a desperate and strong KGFC.<br>
						Lions were missing at least 6 regulars, the most significant being the influential Captain - Somi, Zuhair, Fahad, Khalil, and Mohammed Birkia. Lions were able to field a strong team, though the subs bench was left cold with only 1 player, whilst Abu was itching on the line (linesman) sitting out the game due to the red card he picked in the previous game. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0615lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
