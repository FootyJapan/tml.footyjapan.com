										Video Clip, <b><a class="txlink" href="http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=batch_download&batch_id=Smp2YUROdENvQnMwTVE9PQ" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a></b><br>
										After draining all the energy and resources early on in the season with 10 back to back wins, Lions small but talented and growing squad held off a desperate and strong KGFC.<br>
										Lions were missing at least 6 regulars, the most significant being the influential Captain - Somi, Zuhair, Fahad, Khalil, and Mohammed Birkia. Lions were able to field a strong team, though the subs bench was left cold with only 1 player, whilst Abu was itching on the line (linesman) sitting out the game due to the red card he picked in the previous game.<br>
										Orlando was back in goal after missing the last 3 games, and his amazing reflexes were tested as he pushed out a low near-post shot from 7 yards out in the first 3 minutes.<br>
										KGFC played a fast-paced game with slick passes, and Lions were limited to breaking down build-ups in midfield, with Hideki playing in an unorthodox left back position standing up for the challenge.<br>
										Ahmed and Rafai linked upfront well, but Ahmed's through run was halted a few yards outside the box with a tough but fair challenge.<br>
										Rafai then had a good shuffle across before hitting a dipping shot a yard or 2 above the bar.<br>
										KGFC broke on the right-flank, and a great cross was met at the far post with a good header, only to be denied by Orlando.<br>
										Orlando intercepted another 2 through balls before the striker had any chance of finishing.<br>
										Akira had a rare run upfront and hit a good 20-yarder only to be held by the keeper.<br>
										The second half saw Seyon play his first game for Lions, and as the young lad took his position in defence, Sima was pushed up in midfield.<br>
										The game then changed as the tall and talented Seyon stood up well in defence, whilst Sima played for the first time this season in his favoured midfield position. The game then swayed Lions' way as Sima orchestrated one attack after another with Ken, Rafai, and Ahmed pacing through, only for the KGFC defenders and keeper to make good saves.<br>
										Joe Takeda played well for KGFC in midfield, but with Omar operating around Joe, they cancelled each other out.<br>
										Rafai broke on the right and hit a ball across for Ken, whose effort was blocked by the heroic defenders.<br>
										In the last minute, a through ball found Ken accelerating ahead of 3 defenders on the halfway line, and as he swerved to the left of the keeper, his shot deflected off a stretched defender's leg to agonisingly bounce over the bar. Had that goal went in, the TML may have seen a very talented KGFC relegated to Div 3.<br>
										<b>Man of the Match : Ken Hersche</b><br>
										 <br>
										<b>Lions Season Wrap-up</b>:<br>
										Lions took the TML by surprise this season, by utilising a 4-3-3 formation that worked well with the available players in the first 10 games that sealed promotion for the African giants.<br>
										Despite Lions topping the tables, and KGFC holding up the table, KGFC have been one of the toughest opponents for Lions this season (in both games), along with France.<br>
										There were no easy matches in Div 2, and although the Barbarians clash was the easiest, their position in the table shows they are definitely not the weakest.<br>
										The full Lions squad and management are to be praised, but I would like to specifically pay tribute to 2 players:<br>
										Orlando Torres, the amazing keeper who filled the Lions with confidence at the back, and Ken Hersche, not only Lions' top scorer, but the ever present workhorse striker has managed an impressive 10 goals tally despite playing in defence and midfield on many occasions.<br>
										Also a final word on our Captain - Gaafar Somi, who was a great leader on and off the pitch throughout the season.<br>
