									<p><b>Misato Sunday 30th March</b>,<br>
										Lions' confidence was approaching borderline arrogance when they showed up with 1 substitute including 2 players that have not played for 3 months+ and 1 ill player, with crucial&nbsp;regular individuals missing from upfront (Zuhair), midfield (Raoof and Fahad), and defence (Khalil)....with also the experienced Mohammed ElSheikh and Kowa missing.<br>
										10-man Embassy were always on the back foot from the start, but a break away led to a corner, and with the Lions defence unable to clear, a close range shot ricocheted off the cross bar only to fall to an Embassy player at the far post, who finished calmly onto the far side from Orlando.<br>
										Lions dominated the first half, with Omar dashing past the defenders and placing a fine shot across the goal, only for the keeper to make an amazing save to push the ball wide.<br>
										Lions threw everything, and with the left-back Mo Birkia unleashing a fierce shot from 6 yards out towards the near cross-bar, another miracle save from the keeper pushed the ball out.<br>
										Ken, Ahmed and Abu, were getting frustrated with the keeper saving 1 or 2 good chances from each in the first half (with Ken forced to play the full game with a niggling hamstring).<br>
										Somi dashed past 2 players and as he was 5 yards out, took a great shot with his weaker left foot, only to see the ball hit the wrong side of the net.<br>
										Omar had a 22 yard free kick agonisingly miss the net by a couple of inches.<br>
										A 1st half fair result should've been 4-1 to Lions, yet it was 0-1 to Embassy!<br>
										The second half saw a few changes with Hussein partnering Ahmed upfront, and a few minutes later the ever so reliable Sima in central defence pulled up with a severe hamstring injury that may see him out for the season!<br>
										The under the weather Baghir had to come on again in defence (rather than midfield), but Akira, whom hasn't played more than 1 full game for Lions this season with a knee injury, battled hard and played solidly, with great interceptions and passes in midfield too.<br>
										Ahmed Gaafar was released on the right flank where he outran the Embassy defence, and with the keeper rushing out, and Hussein 5 yards out of a gaping goal and unmarked, Ahmed goes for a near post shot that was held by the keeper. A definite goal opportunity wasted!<br>
										5 minutes later, a replay of that occurred, and with Ahmed expected to do the right thing this time, he again shot at the near post, this time deflected to a corner. Another golden opportunity gone.<br>
										2 minutes later, Ahmed again, same position, this time attempting a change of direction, and lost the ball 6 yards out!<br>
										Hussein was released twice form an onside position, but the quick recovery of defenders blocked an attempted shot, and another saw both players tumble into the box as the ball rolls to safety.<br>
										Ken then found himself facing the keeper from 6 yards out, and his well hit low shot was again miraculously saved by the keeper and pushed wide.<br>
										Hideki (right-back), Baghir, Omar, and Somi...were all throwing balls to the strikers, but the attempts were either wide or saved by the amazing keeper.<br>
										A long ball into the box was well read by Hussein as the defender let the ball bounce, and with Hussein putting his body between the ball and the keeper, both players fell over, and the ball fell 12 yards out to a dashing Gaafar Somi who would usually score from such a position, but his shot went wide.<br>
										A corner saw Gaafar hit the post with a great header from 5 yards out, and another corner saw Hussein's header bounce across the far past with no follow up.<br>
										A few chances at the edge of the box fell to the strikers, with Hussein and Abu taking a few wide shots from the edge of the box without troubling the keeper.<br>
										Abu was back to his old ways where he attempts too many dribbles with no end result.<br>
										A rare counter attack, saw an Embassy player make his way into the box and instead of&nbsp; crossing, a fierce near post shot caught Orlando by surprise, making him concede twice as many goals as he did all season for Lions!<br>
										0-2 to Embassy with less than 10 minutes to go, and with an Embassy defender missing a clearance, Hussein pounced onto the ball that was 5 yards out, and he slotted the ball between the keeper's legs, the keeper went to ground like a lightning, to deflect the ball onto the path of Ken, who from 15 yards out placed the ball nicely, only to find it deflect off the bar!<br>
										If Embassy had a very good keeper, the score could've easily been 6 or 7 for Lions, but they had an amazing keeper, making it the first game where a keeper outshines the super Orlando!<br>
										With the final whistle, Lions realised that they had just lost their first game in over 13 months!<br>
										A fair result 7-1 Lions, actual result, 0-2 Embassy who are gradually pulling out of trouble.<br>
										Considering the long lay-off and also the performance on the day, Akira was one of the best in Lions.<br>
										Lions dropped 5 points in the last 2 games after an amazing 100% run, luckily though, Maritizio were not able to capitalise on this, by losing 3-1 to Zion on the day. France FC are definitely back in contention now for the top 2 spots.<br>
										Man of the Match: Dutch Embassy Keeper!<br>
