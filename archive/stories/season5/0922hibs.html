									<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 22nd September</b>,<br>
										The BFC and Hibs fought out a very even match at Oi Futo. Chances were had by both sides, with the clinching goal coming a minute before the final whistle after a BFC corner was headed in from close range. With the addition of Carlos and Shunsuke the BFC have reformed their team in the last 8 months and will be very difficult to beat for any team in the TML this season.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Through an administration error the Hibs actually played the first 20 minutes with 10 men, despite having subs on the sideline. It didn&rsquo;t seem to matter as the Hibs held field position and possession well. &nbsp;BFC were playing a flat back 4 up the field and were looking susceptible to a break away, which when it finally occurred<br>
										Hitoshi didn't have to make a single save in the first half. The Hibs defense was the strongest it's been since 2006, and the midfield put together some good passing, but<br>
										The BFC back line is strong and fit and the Hibs final ball was letting them down time and tie again, they were unable to create many solid chances.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In the second half people began to tire and both sides had good<br>
										Chances. Andre made an immediate impact, and our best chance came when<br>
										he drew about three defenders, then turned and put Hiro through for a<br>
										1vs1 with the BFC keeper - Hiro managed a decent shot, but it was<br>
										parried away. Kuni had a point blank volley blocked, Bevan won a<br>
										header that put the ball among three Hibs unmarked in the box, but the Hibs stopped playing as the BFC all stopped to call for an offside that wasn&rsquo;t. Play to the whistle&#x2026;.<br>
										Shosuke was beginning to make a few good runs and he is difficult to defend against one on one as he is so quick. Invariable he drew his share of fouls, but almost as inevitably committed his fair portion but his familiar tactic of grabbing the opposition player with both his hands and throwing them to the side. His diminutive stature means he usually gets away with it. Carlos was solid on the ball and tried some long-range shots, but nothing doing. As the game wore down the Hibs began to<br>
										tire, and with about 2 minutes left we gave up several corner kicks in<br>
										a row - they scored on their last one, and that was the game.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A lot of people had strong games, but I thought Yasu was the man of the<br>
										match. We all know he's a talented offensive player, but he&rsquo;s been asked to help on defense this year and he won nearly every ball that came near him on Saturday, and largely shut down Yamagishi - it was only after Yasu had to sub out in<br>
										the second half that he began to give us real problems.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Again, a tough one to lose, but the team is getting better every week<br>
										as we get to know each other. This culture of kicking the ball out when a player sits down clutching his ankle has crept into football like a menace over the past 5 years and needs to be banished. It&rsquo;s nice when we clap the team that gives the ball back to the opposition on a throw in and pretend it&rsquo;s all great sportsmanship, but do footballers need anymore incentive to simulate? Now they&rsquo;re rewarded for simulating injures by completing stopping the play by feigning injury as well as the plague of simulating being fouled. Could you imagine K1 fighters or rugby players asking everyone to stop what they&rsquo;re doing because they have a sore shin? Get on with it. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DICdXTPYgpA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DICdXTPYgpA</a><br>
										Sepp and his mates at FIFA got their head out of the 60&rsquo;s for a moment and placed a rule that the referee is to stop the game, but we still see players as the BFC&rsquo;s striker did in the first half, walking to the sideline and sitting down just inside the field of play so we can all stop and get out the hankies while he rubs his ankle. The urgency to get the ball out is normally in direct proportion to the amount of danger in the ensuing play not in the seriousness of the injury &#150; getting that bruised shin &ldquo;treated&rdquo; 10 seconds earlier will make all the difference. If you see a Hibs player go down clutching his ankle please feel free to complete the ensuing phase of play &#150; I can guarantee you we will. &nbsp;<br>
