										<br>
										The Swiss weren&rsquo;t given an easy task in their first game of the &rsquo;07-&rsquo;08 season, matched up with traditional rivals Sala.&nbsp; Great day on the turf at Oifuto, that is one of the benefits of playing against the league organizer, some quality pitches to play on. &nbsp;Sala looked its familiar self with a solid defensive lineup, speed across the midfield, but the same forward line which meant goals were going to be tough to come by. &nbsp;The Swiss looked their old and grizzled selves, with 5 usual starters out with injury or away on business trips, what a way to start the season. &nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first 3 minutes of the game looked pretty good for the Swiss with a few passes connecting and the occasional run but for the next 36 minutes, Sala dominated. &nbsp;Passes around midfield were swift and the movement out of the back through midfield was great.&nbsp; They put together some beautiful footy and it was tough to watch looking back at the Swiss goal. &nbsp;They looked the better side, winning almost every tackle and really working hard for it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they just could not break down the Swiss defense with a shot on goal.&nbsp; No one would take on anyone in the box, the quality of the crosses were poor, rarely causing danger. &nbsp;The Swiss defense was marshalled by Krando and he did well, as did Phillip and Koin, but Sala made it easy for them.&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no forward who could play with his back to goal and hold it up.&nbsp; The midfielders were forced to shoot from distance and Peter Pauli smothered most of those quite easily.&nbsp; <br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/07/0901salavswiss6.jpg" alt="" height="328" width="248" align="left" border="0" hspace="3">It must have been frustrating for them to dominate so completely but to come away with nothing. &nbsp;The Swiss had a few chances, with Dave Pratt sending across one ball to an unmarked Kirk only for him to head towards the corner flag.&nbsp; Watanabe sent in a beautiful ball for Karl only to see him completely miss the volley.&nbsp; Karl sent Kirk in for a 1 on 1 vs. Sid but he got down well to knock the shot away. &nbsp;Fortunately for the Swiss, in the last minute of the half, they were awarded a free kick about 35 meters out. &nbsp;Krando blasted in a low shot towards goal with Kirk rushing to meet it.&nbsp; The ball went off a defender&rsquo;s leg to wrong-foot Sid and into the net for a very lucky 1-0 lead as the whistle blew about 30 seconds later.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half started similarly although some of the new boys for the Swiss started to show a little better decision making. &nbsp;However, Sala was the better side. &nbsp;The midfield did some great things but the forwards could not find a way through the defense.&nbsp; Instead, the Swiss started to look a little more dangerous with better ball control.&nbsp; More shots came from overlapping midfielders, the most dangerous was a follow up from Ogata who just volleyed wide after Sid parried a Krando free-kick. &nbsp;In the end, the match was settled as a result of a mistake by Sid in goal.&nbsp; Karl sent in a corner kick towards Dave Pratt at the near post, he and the defender cut right in front of Sid who came out to punch it. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it went in off his hands into the goal.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t pretty but a 2-0 lead with the best of Sala behind them meant it was going to be difficult. &nbsp;In the closing 15 minutes, the midfield for Sala continued to work very hard.&nbsp; Kirk dropped back to help out in defense and JP substituted half the team to wind up the match.&nbsp; It was very lucky for the Swiss but that is typically the way things go for them against Sala.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t come so easy against the Hibs or the BFC, so let&rsquo;s get it together for next week&rsquo;s match!<br>
