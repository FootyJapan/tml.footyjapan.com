									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 20th October</b>,<br>
										Since the TML started the Geckoes had played the Swiss eight times in the league and never picked up a point, in fact they&rsquo;d only scored four goals so it&rsquo;s fair to say that the Swiss would have been feeling quite confident going into the game. However the Geckoes showed when they played BFC a couple of weeks ago, the majority of the game with ten men, that they are no pushovers and they certainly proved that during the game. <br>
										The Swiss kicked off and started the stronger and deservedly took the lead early on. A free kick was delivered into the box and the forward got there before Goro in goal and it was 1-0 Swiss. From this early set back the Geckoes started to get back in to the game and equalised through Jonathan Rodrigues. Kazu Kikuchi had a powerful shot from the edge of the area that the Swiss keeper could only parry and Jonathan was there to smash the ball home. 1-1 was the half time score and that was probably a fair reflection on the game. <br>
										The Geckoes started the second half strongly and took the lead in the third minute thanks to the outstanding Jonathan Smith&rsquo;s second goal of the season. A free kick from Kosuke was only half cleared by the Swiss defence and Jonathan smashed it in from close range.<br>
										The Swiss then started to attack more and the equaliser came from a great header from Cap&rsquo;n Kirk who somehow managed to get in front of Ian (who had a spectacular game defensively overall) and headed the ball into the far corner. From that point on the game opened up and became end to end.<br>
										The Geckoes took the lead again after Mike Bacon scored his first ever goal for the club and the third of the day after receiving the ball in the box and finished with no mistake.<br>
										The Swiss started to push forward looking for a third equaliser but were caught in possession and punished with Kazu Kikuchi&rsquo;s first goal of the season. Kazu picked the ball up in midfield, shrugged off the challenge of the Swiss defender and dispatched it nicely into the bottom corner.<br>
										The Swiss continued to push forward and were fortunate not to concede another after Jonathan Smith hit the bar and the keeper was forced into a couple of saves. They did have chances to get back in to the game but the Geckoes defence was excellent and Goro dealt with anything that got through. <br>
										The final goal of the game was probably Geckoes best. Kazu picked the ball up on the wing, laid it off to Kosuke who smacked the ball into the top corner from about 20 yards. <br>
										The final score of 5-2 was possibly a little harsh on the Swiss but the Geckoes certainly deserved their win.&nbsp;<br>
