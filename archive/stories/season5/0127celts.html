									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 27th January</b>,<br>
										Celts had a disappointing 1-1 draw with YCAC on Sunday. Hopes were high after the win over Swiss less the week before, but in truth the game never got going.<br>
										A poor game on a difficult pitch lacked the excitement of the early season 3-3 draw, partially due to the fact both sides were missing key players.<br>
										Celts had the better of the the chances in the first half, despite losing Henry through injury and took the lead when Take smashed a brilliant strike across the face of goal when a corner wasnt properly cleared. The rest of the half was pretty uneventful apart from a couple of efforts from Toru.<br>
										Half time instructions to raise the tempo at half time were followed by the Celts losing the ball from their own kick off as the YCAC pressure mounted with the wind on their backs. Twice we got away with it, first when Aki performed a brilliant save with his feet from the ex-Stoneds striker Yoshioka, and the second when the same striker looked to have scored only for Gav to make a brilliant clearance. when he knocked the ball off the bar from on the goalline. YCAC claimed it, but pretty hard to hit the outside of a round crossbar from behind the line, and full credit for chasing an almost lost cause.<br>
										The YCAC defense then took over their own linesman duties, when twice Jonesie was through on goal, only to be flagged, at least once when they guy hadnt even been watching the game, seemed the center backs had this voice command remocon when they shouted offside, the flag went up! YCAC equalised with 15 to go, when Tyson was again left free at the back post for a corner, Aki went to catch but fumbled, the ball bouncing a full yard over the line. Linesman flagged for a corner, being right in line it doesnt matter which side of the goal you are at, if you can see the whole ball off the pitch surely its out,no whistle, flag still up, ball bounces around 2,3,4 seconds, flag still up, eventually it goes in... flag still up....bad decision, but we will get on with it... I wont be whinging about the ref in next weeks match report like the Swissless reporter (who wasnt even at last weeks Celts v Swissless game) this week. In the end a draw a fair result based on chances created, just the manner in which it happened was disappointing. Also annoying to see a YCAC player, who shant be named but has a history with TML refs scream at the referree &quot;what the f**k are you doing&quot; when a free kick was given against his team and not even be spoken too. Be good if that could be stamped out...<br>
