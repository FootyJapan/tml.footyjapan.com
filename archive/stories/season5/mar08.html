					<p><b>Misato Sunday 30th March</b>,<br>
						Celts cruised to comfortable 3-0 win over BFC Vagabonds&nbsp; on miserable Sunday afternoon in Misato.&nbsp; Having had a recent run of defeats in cup and league it was with a renewed optimism that Celts took to the task at hand. Despite 3 players deciding a night out in the &quot;Pong&quot; was conducive to pre-match preparations &amp; also missing some key players, Celts were still fielding a strong line-up. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0330celts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>OiFuto dirt, Sunday 30th March</b>,<br>
						Good day for a game, unfortunately it finished poorly as there were more missed chances than anything else. The Swiss should probably have held out for a 1-0 win but a remarkable substitution of a brand new player who had not touched a ball in two years, combined with that player&rsquo;s beautiful pass to the opposition in the final third, allowed the BEFC to knock it past a stranded Peter for the tying goal. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0330swiss.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato Sunday 23rd March</b>,<br>
						In a fairly fought match between two physical sides, Sala showed more attacking quality and better teamwork to come out on top at Misato.&nbsp; A goal in each half for Sala and a late penalty for Celts left the game at&nbsp;2-1&nbsp;come the final whistle, and left Sala still within striking distance of the top two.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						The game had started brightly for Celts and saw them winning the vital midfield battle, overpowering Sala in the air and gaining a&nbsp;territorial advantage.&nbsp; From this fothold, they were able to launch numerous attacks in the first 15 minutes, although most of these attacks lacked any real guile on the deck, and with the Sala defence holding strong, Celts were only able to turn their superiority into a series of corner kicks. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0323sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Hibs made the trek out to Misato to take on the Geckoes expecting the usual hurricane winds and lunar surface, but the conditions weren't too bad - reasonably flat, nice weather and mild winds - so no excuses on that front. Both teams were up for it and tried to impose their style on the game early.<br>
						<br>
						Hibs got some passing going and had a nice build up that led to an early shot by Kuni off the post, but then the hard-charging Gecks began to pick off our passes and force mistakes in our backfield. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0323hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Swiss expectations for a good game on a nice pitch were high, especially since our last two outings had been windy howlers on pitches like tambos in Chiba.&nbsp; Unfortunately, one must remember that this is the TML, and it just cannot be allowed. With the Charity 6's postponed due to heavy rain, one may have been forgiven for thinking the 1 TML game of the day would also be cancelled.

					<p><b>Hachioji Park Suday 9th March</b>,<br>
						The prospect of an hour and a half journey from Yokohama proved too much for some of our teammates but the bare 11 hardy souls who braved the trip made it worthwhile, taking home the 3 points that will keep YCAC in the top flight next year.<br>
						&nbsp;<br>
						Seems a bit soft to talk about&nbsp;relegation&nbsp;after the 3 points shot the club up to 4th spot but without a now perfect record against the bottom 2 teams YCAC would have been deep in the mire with them.. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0309ycac.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The phrase &quot;Famous Last Stands&quot; usually brings to mind the image of valiant but ultimately unsuccessful combat against overwhelming odds - Custer's regiment defended stoutly but ended up getting some very unbecoming haircuts from Sitting Bull's braves, and even the fabled 300 Spartans were ultimately kebabbed by the Persian hordes. But in the Battle of Yamate Hill on Sunday the Albion Old Boys overcame a two-man disadvantage in the first-half and a hometown gale in the second to record an unlikely come-from-behind win against YCAC 2nds. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0309aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Sala kept themselves in the hunt for the TML title with a hard fought victory over Geckoes in Saitama on Sunday.<br>
						An emotional day saw touching drama on the touchline as Charles announced his immediate retirement from the Chiba side, having been handpicked to lead an expedition to find the world&rsquo;s longest snake.<br>
						Worse was to follow when it became clear that Clarkey would not be coming due to an accident with a piano (Dropped on his head?)<br>
						<br>
						Nevertheless Sala threw themselves into the action from the start, fighting back the tears, and went one up inside the first ten minutes.<br>
						Some nice interplay between Brookey and Pete on the right flank saw the naturalized Englishman cut inside and arrow a wicked 20 yard shot into the top right corner.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0309sala.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>
