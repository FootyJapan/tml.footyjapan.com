									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 11th November</b>,<br>
										A headless horseman rode through hajioji park. He was followed by a pale horse. I think I was the only one who saw them. The surface water was a couple inches deep in places, pooling up to 3 meters in diameter. Vags burned off valuable energy in vain trying to squeegee it off. Steve G with an ingenous, though heavy, tool &#150; a goal &#150; which removed about 2% of the water and warmed us up, to say the least. Evening is a crap time to play a match but who is complaining. The ref was late but smelled good when he showed up, just in time for a downpour that put back the 2% with interest.<br>
										<br>
										First half the Jets were subjected to a demoralizing onslaught of effort, skill and tenacious attacking. Amazingly only 1 goal materialized, Jets didn't get a sniff at the other end. Well a sniff maybe but not a bite. The puddling at our end as exasperating for their attack force and for our defence but Ged and Steve have played in puddles before, back in England. Mayhem and comedy combined in fountains of kicked rain.<br>
										<br>
										Water on a pitch plays havoc with your habitual sense &#150; like joining up dots in a reflected image, or driving a panhard amoured car. In both of these examples, you would do better if you didn't know how to write, or didn't know how to drive (a car) respectively. It is sort of stupifying. <br>
										<br>
										The first goal: Back to goal at the edge of the box Alex lifted a clever curling pass to the corner which escaped a desperate jets defender and Gary put it back across the box. Alex swung and missed, a defender tapped it out 8 yards and  Muzzy coolly planted it wide of the lost keeper. 1-0. The two kids up front were burning off the bentos they scoffed before the game with enviable grace. But every fecking time the ball hit a puddle at a crucial moment &#150; the jets 12th man &#150; and it came to squat. On another day&#x2026;.<br>
										<br>
										Still the scamps didn't relent, nor try much different except their hot knife through butter approach. No more goals. Second half Jets punched in 2 good goals in a short space, grew in confidence and made us look like monkeys. 2-1 down after a rapacious first half. What next? But today, we had the benefit of hubris after last weeks performance. Beating YCAC in the style that we did, left none of us with a curtain or rock to hide behind. There were no fishermen, hikers, pool sharks, etc. in the vagabonds any more. A watershed was reached &#150; irreversible and flowing somewhere. All footballers &#150; we had obligations. One of them was not to be beaten by a lesser team. On the day Jets &#150; no disrespect to them &#150; were the lesser team. <br>
										<br>
										The Alexs were not going to score today &#150; that became apparent midway through the second half. Nothing to do with their workrate. They were just beaten by the conditions and their modus operandi.<br>
										<br>
										Less than 10 minutes remaining A-chan broke onto a through pass, beat 2 puddles and shot, the keepers rebound came off a defenders hand and we had a penalty. Simon scored &#150; he never misses penalties. From then on we peppered Jets with attacks, numerous corners and free kicks but they held on and the final score a draw.<br>
										<br>
										Some ratings. Ged 8/10 &#150; one of his better games this season. Steve 7/10 &#150; always imposing but for those who know him he was a shade less involved than usual ( too many wine gums?). Muzzy &#150; 7.5/10 &#150; great goal, some good headers, quite hungover. Graham 8/10 &#150; up and back and alert constantly. Wayne 7/10 &#150; shunted around a bit, didn't play much today but had one good shot. Paul 7.5/10 molten mother of pearl as usual but beaten by the coarse puddles more than by Jets players, some killer passes and great position &#150; but crippling conditions for him. Simon &#150; 8.5/10 another major game for the vegee and he soaked up the conditions. Gary 7.5/10 &#150; a fair bit of running and interceptions, passing ok but heading poor. Lindsey 7.5/10 &#150; existential issues in the taxi back but played his usual cool game, and as often (except against BFC), keeping 50% in the tank &#150; for what I couldn't tell you. Alex S 8/10 &#150; no goals but great movement and attacking force. A-chan (don't know his usual ability) but looked impressive and played well with Alex S.  Nick 7/10 &#150; another non-chalant player in the class of Graham but sure-footed and improving each game. Taylor &#150; 8.5/10. Very difficult conditions but he hardly noticed &#150; fired up still from last weeks virtuoso performance against YCAC. Kev G (6/10) &#150; wasn't on for much but whacked some good balls from wing back down the line. Adrian  - didn't play a minute. Richard &#150; not a minute. <br>
										<br>
										There were a few frayed nerves today, a bit of tension, and the sound of crankshafts groaning under the strain of higher expectations. Where will it end? I ask myself.<br>
