						OiFuto 1 pitch looked like a good surface after a drizzle, and Lions thought they had a major advantage against 8-men KGFC, but holidays, injuries and work, forced 3 changes that saw 2 of the defenders replaced, and a major re-shuffle necessary with Zuhair the reliable striker forced to play as a centre-back, Akira starting his first game this season after a knee injury saw him slot into an unfavoured right-back position, and Hussein also playing out of position as a left-back. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/1222lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						There are no more gimmees in the TML - the Jets have had their struggles this season but they jumped all over us at Hachioji. The Hibs were disorganized and scattered in the first half, and they chased us all over - it felt like they outnumbered us on the pitch. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/1215hibs.html" target="_blank">more from Hibs...</a><br>

							Jets Ain't Quite Tough Enough.<br>
						</b>Having not won a league game since August and picking up only 2 points out of the last 24 available it becomes increasingly difficult to put a positive spin on things, however, with the exception of the debacle against Sala, performances have been decent in spite of results. Losing to Hibs is, of course, nothing to be ashamed of, as they are a very good side with some outstanding wide men. Indeed, the Jets can probably take some comfort from the manner of the defeat: one-nil up at half-time despite being under almost constant pressure, and still in front after 20 second half minutes of what was now a pummeling. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/1215jets.html" target="_blank">more from JETs ...</a><b><br>

						A swerving, dipping, stinging, rasping 30 yard free kick from returning captain Stephen Brooke-Smith won a depleted Sala the three points in a hard-fought game against the Embassy under lights at Hachioji.<br>
						<br>
						After spending weeks on the sidelines with some sort of very serious, career threatening injury, Brookie was forced to recall himself to the starting line up when only 12 Sala players made themselves available. To make matters worse he was also suffering from a bout of Saizeria induced food poisoning, to which the 300 passengers on the middle carriage of the last Sobu line train back to Tsudanuma that night can surely attest to. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/1215sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
