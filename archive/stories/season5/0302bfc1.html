									<p><b>ASIJ Sunday 2nd March</b>,<br>
										Imagine the scene, you go to a local izakaiya for a few beers after a game and get back to Tokyo late on a Sunday evening only to realise you have left your wallet in the depths of west Tokyo and need to make a 2 hour round trip to get it back!!! What can make that seem OK? Well how about a 4-3 victory against YCAC or better still a 4-3 victory when you have come back from being 3-1 down&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;The BFC started this game slowly, very slowly if fact and found themselves 1-0 down after 20 minutes. The response was, however, almost immediate through a fine strike from Carlos which arrowed into the far bottom corner from the edge of the area. This didn&rsquo;t last long with a cleverly worked free kick giving back YCAC the lead as half time approached. Stern words were exchanged at half-time relating to the lack of communication, poor passing and route one style that was being employed on all too frequent a basis. With the rallying call that the title was on the line in this game BFC went out for the second half but soon found themselves 3-1 down after a great strike that rocketed in off the underside on the bar. The good news at this point was that instead of usual the BFC pattern of bickering leading to a spiral of self destruction the attitude was positive and resolve strengthened that we could turn this game around. This belief was helped when Shosuke, who now playing up front, was causing YCAC all kinds of difficulties. Off he went on a mazy run down the left before squaring to Sam Morson (making his BFC debut) who coolly slotted the ball into the far corner having wrong footed the goalie. The inspirational Shosuke moments later went on a duplicate run but this time decided to finish the move off himself lifting the ball over the keeper into the far corner. Emotions were running high on and off the pitch and the BFC searched for the winner, however, they had to rely on the woodwork to keep the the score all square before another Shosuke run led to him being forced across the edge on the area by 5 defenders who had no option but to bring him down to end the run. Garry was certain this was his chance to be the hero of the day and riffled home the resulting free-kick into the far bottom corner which was met by a scream of &quot;THAT&rsquo;S WHAT I AM F*?KING TALKING ABOUT&quot; from the sidelines. YCAC pushed forward in search of an equaliser but BFC held out for a famous victory. So off to the izakaiya we headed and the aforementioned wallet was left by yours truly&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;not before an old dear trod on Al's new&nbsp;trainers as we stood in the entrance - the old&nbsp;girl was then politely informed that the aforementioned pump was in fact a rather pricey item of Italian manufacture that had in fact been recently been procured &quot;FOR F*?K's SAKE THEY'RE ME NEW PRADAS&quot; screamed Himmer in protest!!!<br>
										Apart from the result and fantastic spirit shown the good news was compounded by the return on Pink Neil Collins who despite a long absence was looking on good form with more than a few flashes of brilliance.<br>
										Man of the match or at least of the second half: Shosuke<br>
										Notable mention for Sam who looks like he could fit well in to the BFC should his move become a permanent one.<br>
										Moment of the match: Joe T being whacked in the face by referee George as he raised his arm to indicate an indirect free kick<br>
