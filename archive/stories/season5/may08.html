					<p><b>Fuchu no Mori, Saturday 31st May</b>,<br>
						Barbarians needed a point to ensure 2nd Division survival without having to rely on other results. Kicking off with 10 men v 11 was not ideal and despite the rain and mud the team rose to the occassion going in 3-0 up at half-time with 2 goals from Toshi and a 3rd from wide-boy Eduardo.<br>
						The 2nd half was pretty much a rear-guard action as Barbarians soaked up wave after wave of Jetro attack and it was only in the last minute that they managed to squeeze in a consolation.<br>
						See you all again next year.......<br>

						Things were certainly not looking good at half time.&nbsp; Perhaps the knowledge that a win would be enough to keep the Embassy in the First Division was playing on our minds (well actually a draw but you must never think like that, right?) <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0525befc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						France FC saved Lions&rsquo; blushes after Zion managed a 2-1 against the Div 2 leaders Lions, with Lions missing a handful of opportunities that could&rsquo;ve made the game and season safe. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0525lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato Saturday 17th May</b>,<br>
						Last week the red faces were from embarrassment at being on the pointy end of a 4-0 tonking; this week the red faces were from sunburn and bursting blood vessels as the Albion Old Boys huffed, puffed, and eventually flopped knackered over the season's finish line with a hard-earned 3-2 win over Tokyo Panthers. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0517aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 17th May</b>,<br>
						The Saitama Jets managed to finish a torrid season on a positive note as they were at last able to record a victory over one of their relegation rivals and offer themselves a hope of staying up, albeit dependant on other results. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0517jets.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						So you've been here a while and you start to think you know how things work. You know, for example, that for the average Tokyo groundsman the sight of a passing dog cocking his leg in the centre circle sometime on Wednesday afternoon is reason enough to cancel all fixtures the following weekend. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season5/0511aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
