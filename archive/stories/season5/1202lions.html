									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 2nd</b>,<br>
										The first Sunday of December was blessed by beautiful weather, and was to hold the&nbsp;awaited clash in Division 2 between 2 unbeaten teams, Lions, with a 100% record, and Maritizio, unbeaten in 4 games.<br>
										Lions lined up with their full squad, whilst Maritizio although looking strong, did have a guest keeper from Vags between the posts.<br>
										Maritizio started the game strongly, and showed they meant business by notching the first attempt on goal&nbsp;via a powerful header from their tall striker, from the edge of the box,&nbsp;but not troubling Lions'&nbsp;safe hands, Orlando (aka Spiderman).<br>
										Lions' young lads combination upfront proved lethal about 10 minutes into the game, when Maritizio's&nbsp;keeper, Taylor, could only parry a shot, and as he&nbsp;burrowed to keep the ball in control, Lion's striker Ken Hersche used his body well to shield the ball, pass it calmly to the edge of the box, for Omar (Golden Boy), who calmy slotted into the bottom right corner (slight deflection).<br>
										20 minutes later, AbuBakr weaved his way through the left side, and placed the ball beyond the keeper, but Ken was at the far post to place the ball into an empty net.<br>
										Henry (from KanoCelts) came on for Maritizio, and did look like causing a few problems, but Gaafar Somi took full responsibility of the midfield and made sure Martizio were limited to long (usually blocked) attempts.<br>
										Maritizio's left winger Tim, tried hard, but his crosses only fell to Orlando.<br>
										With 5 minutes to go in the first half, some good play saw Zuhair through on the right, and as he chipped Taylor, everybody wondered, why did Zuhair place the ball so far to the other side and not on target...but out of nowhere came AbuBakr (apparently only Zuhair saw him)...diving low to head the ball in at the far post for Lions' 3rd.<br>
										One or 2 more chances fell to Lions, but Maritizio fought well to keep the ball out and limit the score to 3-0.<br>
										The second half saw Lions rest Zuhair, and putting on the pacey Ahmed Gaafar upfront. Within a few seconds from kick-off, a misplaced pass by Lions saw Maritizio break into the box, but an amazing dash and save from Orlando denied Maritizio a definete goal. This shows how both teams played, 1 misplaced pass could end up in the net!<br>
										Half way through the second half, Ahmed Gaafar dashed down the left wing past 2 players, but Taylor rushed out and pushed the ball to a corner. Gaafar Somi rose at the near post to head in the 4th for Lions.<br>
										5 minutes later, a rash tackle saw Maritizio fairly awarded a penalty.<br>
										Orlando is determined to keep a clean sheet, but having been out all night and having no sleep at all the night before, he had to rely on his adrenalin rush (well and the red bull)....and as the Maritizio player took the penalty, Orlando made a great save, but a Maritizio player followed up and put the ball in the net. Orlando was so mad at the Lions defence, but luckily, and fairly, the referee asked for a retake, becasue the Maritizio players rushed into the box before the penalty was taken.<br>
										The same player stepped up, and guess what? Orlando saved again!! This time making sure he parried the ball sideways!<br>
										With 10 minutes to go, Omar put a brilliant ball, bisecting the Maritizio defence, and Tatsuya (Conejo) outpaced all, but his ball across fell to a Maritizio defender who hoofed the ball away.<br>
										Maritizio threatened and 2 back to back clearnace on the near nad far posts by Ken and Mo Birkia, kept the score at 4-0. Another chance fell to Maritizio and a great block 7 yards out by Zuhair (then on as a defender) saved a possible goal.<br>
										With a few minutes to go, Omar saved the best for last, when he struck a beautiful 30-yarder, only to see Taylor backpaddling helplessly as the ball hit the back of the net to make it 5-0 to Lions.<br>
										Biggest win for Lions, against a strong Maritizio, unbeaten, in a 6-pointer!<br>
										Lions were on form, every player on the pitch battled (especially Baghir), and the referee Jorge Kuriyama, who pleaded for some entertaining football before the game, not only refereed well, but witnessed one of the games of the season.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Man of the Match:  Lions :)...I could not leave out AbuBakr's brilliant play, Omar's 2 goals and 30-yarder, Orlando's 2 penalty saves on his birthday weekend, Zuhair's magical style, Ken's 200% effort, Baghir's battles, Somi's composure, or the now consistent Lions defenders who (touch wood) are keeping a fourth consecutive clean sheet!<br>
