									<p><b>OiFuto, Saturday 1st September</b>,<br>
										Skipper Jon Day told his team at half time what he wanted, and the team duly obliged as BFC started the defence of the TML Division 1 title with a 3-0 win over the newly promoted British Embassy FC. Goals from 17 year old Shawn on his debut, a clinical penalty by Carlos and a fine individual goal from another debutant, Jerry, saw off the Embassy in the season opener for both teams.<br>
										<br>
										Lining up with Jason in goal, Leigh, James Mulligan, Brian and Ryo in defence, BFC was determined to keep tight at the back - a cornerstone of their success from last year. Pablo and Carlos worked the center of midfield putting in a huge effort, and with Shosuke and Garry starting on the wings there was plenty of creativity on display. Up front, a very young and talented forward line of Dan and Sean sought to unsettle the Embassy backline with their pace and ability on the ball. <br>
										<br>
										The game, played in excellent spirit and officiated very well by the impressive 'Jorge the Ref', sprung in to life in the opening minutes with young Shawn reacting first to a cross from Shosuke to jump above the static Embassy keeper and head the ball hard and low into the corner - textbook. A hammer blow - to quote BFC legend Dr Lowes - for the Embassy, and a dream start for BFC. <br>
										<br>
										BFC played well throughout, though not as fluidly as they ended last season, with the cobwebs being dusted and those few extra pounds gained during the summer months being run (well, mostly run) off. Still, BEFC got little change from an industrious BFC midfield, marshaled by Carlos - as cool as ever on the ball - and supported by the tireless - and vocal - Pablo and Garry. <br>
										<br>
										The forwards kept the ball well despite the close attention of the Embassy back line, providing the team a chance to keep the majority of the possession. Both teams rolled the subs throughout, with BFC giving debuts to Iain and Brittin who both came on in midfield. Shosuke meanwhile started his season where he left off last, embarking on a series of dizzying runs past players throughout the game, but BFC perhaps too often surrendered possession needlessly with a sloppy final ball, or not choosing the simple pass to feet. Yet overall the approach was positive with plenty of chances created. Garry and Ryo forged a promising partnership on the right, and with the defence mostly solid things augured well for the defending champions. <br>
										<br>
										It wasn't all one way though, and BEFC showed flashes of the form that won them the Division 2 title last year. Unfortunately for the Embassy, for all their industry and bustle, the final ball was lacking. On the odd occasion when the ball got over the top or in behind the back four, it was always a touch too long making things easy for the commanding Jason in goal. Aside from a couple of first half forays and two instances in the second half, the BFC keeper was not troubled.<br>
										<br>
										Determined to build on the 1-0 lead and wanting to put the game beyond the Embassy in the second half, BFC had to first weather a storm from kick off. A few mistimed passes under pressure raised the volume and anxiety from the back four in particular, as the team somewhat laboured through the beginning of the half. When Shawn was brought down in the box chasing a through ball from Leigh, the ref correctly pointed to the spot. Carlos stepped up and dispatched a perfect penalty, all but ending the Embassy resistance. <br>
										<br>
										An earlier change had seen the arrival of Jerry up front, and after being caught offside several times, he finally made his mark. Receiving the ball to feet Carlos, and with plenty to do, he danced his way around a few defenders (at least three) and the keeper before finishing with aplomb, capping a superb debut and securing three points for BFC.<br>
										<br>
										With nine regular players from last season not present (through work, injury, illness or having moved on), and four players making their league/club debuts, this was an excellent start for the BFC. Nobody however is underestimating the challenge that lies ahead this season, and BFC will need a full squad available every week to successfully defend their title. One player they will have to do without for a few weeks is Shosuke, who was on the end of one particularly heavy late challenge which saw him head to hospital for x-rays. Fortunately last year's player of the year seems to have badly bruised his ankle rather than anything more serious and will hopefully make a speedy recovery.<br>

											<br>
											(I guess we're all 'well-up' for it when we play league games, but let's not forget we all have jobs to go to come Monday and this isn't easily achieved from a hospital bed - firm but fair is the way to go and referees will be clamping down on late challenges and abusive comments made on the field and from touch line - which could result in not just more cards, but offending teams having points deducted.

										<b>ALSO NOTE THERE ARE NO PHOTOS OF THIS GAME DESPITE THE CAMERA BEING THERE = THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THE TEAMS DID NOT USE THE PUMA MATCH BALLS JUST GIVEN TO THEM!!!!  WE WORK HARD TO GET SPONSORSHIP, SO PLEASE TRY &amp; HELP US KEEP IT!!!</b></p>
