									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 13th October</b>,<br>
										Wow.  Stone me!  Cor blimey. Shockaroony. Flawless performances from Sala certainly number fewer than hairs on Clarkey&rsquo;s head, but this must have been close. On top of that, a Sala clean sheet is currently sitting between the Amur Leopard and Iberian Lynx atop the WWF&rsquo;s Critically endangered/Feared extinct- species list.<br>
										A stonking first twenty minutes on the plains of the great Misato dust bowl, had Vagabonds on the ropes, but they kept themselves in it up until the third goal, midway through the second half. Scotty&rsquo;s last minute goal was the icing on the cake, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone could argue that it wasn&rsquo;t deserved.<br>
										Vagabonds are a tough side and I&rsquo;m not just saying that in the same way that foreign football coaches used to see Scotland&rsquo;s name tumble out the hat into their World Cup group and announce to the awaiting media that &ldquo;Scotland will be our most difficult game/feared opponent&#x2026;&rdquo; Whilst licking their lips in lieu of the impending slaughter. Vags have got some top midfielders who have plenty of tricks, also in Lyndsey Hughes they have one of the league&rsquo;s most promising young linesmen and in Alex Sahara probably one of the best strikers. Ye gads is he fast! Reminiscent of Brookey when there&rsquo;s a check to be paid. That he didn&rsquo;t get much of a sniff in this game was entirely down to excellent performances in the Sala defence, particularly by Yusuke.<br>
										The first half was wonderful to watch from a Sala perspective, neat interplay, using the width, retaining possession and all those other things you talk about before the game and forget as soon as the whistle blows.<br>
										The first goal was nice, Dhugal latching on to a pass in the box, rounding Taylor and slotting home from an acute angle, whilst making it all look very easy. The second though was even better. Dan beat two players on the right(Yes, DAN!) and cut into the middle, before playing a one-two with Dhugal on the edge of the box, then laying it into Toby&rsquo;s path and he knocked it home with aplomb. Throughout the half, Sala passed well and looked dangerous everytime they went forward. Masa and Scotty ran their legs into the dust and Dan and Lenny used every opportunity to make gains both on the flanks and coming inside.<br>
										Toward the end of the half Toby was denied by the crossbar after a great first touch and chipped shot which would have been an absolute peach had it gone in.<br>
										Sala started the second half slowly and Vags had a fair bit of possesion but they couldn&rsquo;t find a killer pass to unlock Sala&rsquo;s defence.<br>
										Midway through the half, the introduction of Charles and debuts for Peter and Giles, saw Sala finally put the game to bed.<br>
										Peter scampered down the right and floated over a well weighted cross for Charles to head low into the corner from twelve yards; just can&rsquo;t stop scoring, this lad. It was the least Peter deserved after an impressive twenty minute spell. Though some people might question Taylors&rsquo;s speed in getting down to the ball, I think it&rsquo;s fairest to say that it was a pacey, well placed header that would have befuddled even the top shot stoppers in world football, and I do like to be fair.<br>
										The final goal came from nice link-up play involving Peter, Toby and finally debutant Giles who rolled it nicely into Scotty&rsquo;s path and he side footed into the corner from 10 yards with effectively the last kick of the game.<br>
										Taylor didn&rsquo;t quite manage to leave the park without having a go at my header. After walking several paces towards the showers, he turned round and announced, &ldquo;That header was S*#T!&rdquo; This, whilst being true, was the funniest thing I heard all day until Brookey used the word phallus instead of fallacy during a post game beer. The revealing of which means I probably won&rsquo;t feature in anymore games this season. Ah, tyrants&#x2026;<br>
