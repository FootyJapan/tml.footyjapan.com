									<p><b>Hodogaya Koen, Sunday 25th May</b>,<br>
										France FC saved Lions&rsquo; blushes after Zion managed a 2-1 against the Div 2 leaders Lions, with Lions missing a handful of opportunities that could&rsquo;ve made the game and season safe. Lions were only 13 on the day missing their star keeper Orlando through injury, the magnificent striker Zuhair, the Captain Somi, the talented Hideki, the speedy &lsquo;conejo&rsquo; Tatsuya, and the solid Zima, plus a few more!<br>
										<br>
										Akira, the central defender had to go in goal for Lions, with the top scorer Ken playing as a right-back.<br>
										Zion went ahead when a through ball found their striker onside. Lions then pulled level via Fahad by a majestic header looping over the helpless keeper In the second half Zion went ahead and at that time plenty of chances fell to Lions who could not capitalise. The dangerous efforts were from well-taken free-kicks by the debutant Rufai &lsquo;Eddie&rsquo;, the 19-year old who looked sharp, strong and quick. Abu could&rsquo;ve levelled with 5 minutes to go when a cross from Ken was nodded through by Ahmed, and Abu was 6 yards out and had time to control the ball to his favoured left foot, but a hurried shot with his weaker right tamely fell to the keeper.<br>
										Raoof and Khalil played really well, with the latter hanging on through 40 minutes of pain with an injury.<br>
										Mo Birkia was a few yards out on the right and onside, and instead of cutting the ball across the goal for 3 Lions players, he took a near post shot that hit the outside of the side-netting.<br>
										Baghir had a similar chance, but again shot wide.<br>
										In the last minute, Eddie fought his way through and as he muscled the defender 5 yards out, and managed to make contact with a difficult ball, the Zion keeper parried the ball and followed up to hold the ball.<br>
										Lions lost their second game of the season, themselves only to blame.<br>
										Lions still needed only 1 point to win the league (on goal difference) if Maritizio beat France.<br>Lions stayed on the sidelines to support France against Maritizio, and a brilliant start saw France go 2-0 up, and despite being a man down (red card) in second half, France shocked Maritizio with a 5-1 win to keep their dream alive of getting promoted, and with that defeat, Maritizio ended their hopes of catching up with Lions, who were then crowned Champions of Division 2!<br>
										Lions wearing the France national kit, had to rely on France FC to celebrate the championship with 2 games to go.<br>
										Lions owe it to France to beat Maritizio in their next game to throw France a lifeline of promotion, and to end the season on a high with hopefully 2 back-to-back wins and 40 points!<br>
										Man of the Match: Difficult to choose between a hardworking and out of position Ken, a workhorse and goal scorer Fahad, and one of the best debuts for the young Rufai (Eddie).<br>
