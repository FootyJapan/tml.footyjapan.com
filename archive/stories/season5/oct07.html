					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 28th October</b>,<br>
						After last week&rsquo;s humiliation at the hands of Sala the Saitama Jets were looking to bounce back against YCAC. The Jets delivered a performance big on heart and commitment, recovering from two goals down, but crucially lacking in quality and eventually succumbed to a late winner. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1028jets.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

We also had perfect weather and new kit, and the still bitter memory of the 3-0 whipping YCAC laughingly gave us last season. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1021hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

Was this to be the fateful day when we would lose our Div. 1 virginity and post some points on the board? It certainly felt like it.

					<p><b>Hanno Misugidai, Saturday 20th October</b>,<br>
						Sala recorded their highest ever league victory over a depleted Jets side on Saturday amongst the mountains of Hanno, in distant Saitama. It&rsquo;s a nice little pitch though a bit on the short side.<br>
						<br>
						Sala got out of the blocks quickly and piled the pressure on the Jets backline with neat, short passing and some pace on the flanks.<br>
						<br>
						In fact there were so many chances in the opening fifteen minutes that it would be fair to say that Sala were extremely unlucky not to find themselves four or five goals to the good. Toby and Dhugal could each have had a first half hat trick, and on another day probably would have. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1020sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 21st October</b>,<br>
						On a day where Lions were missing 1 or 2 key players in defence and midfield, the least worry should have been the attack. Dutch Embassy started with 8 players, and went up to 9 players after 15 minutes or so. Lions had 15 players, 7 of those are attacking players. Playing against an incomplete team should be difficult, because of sitting back, meaning less chances created. BUT!, that wasnt the case! Dutch Embassy had 1 attempt at goal and&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;corners throughout the game, with Lions creating enough chances to give Dutch Embassy a negative goal difference that would take them 2 seasons to recover from! <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1021lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Since the TML started the Geckoes had played the Swiss eight times in the league and never picked up a point, in fact they&rsquo;d only scored four goals so it&rsquo;s fair to say that the Swiss would have been feeling quite confident going into the game. However the Geckoes showed when they played BFC a couple of weeks ago, the majority of the game with ten men, that they are no pushovers and they certainly proved that during the game. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1020wsg.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Finally, Footy Japan are able to offer a tournament along the lines of the ones many players have been travelling to in SE Asia. A 2-day affair, with qualifying followed by knockout rounds. Due to the lack of availability of grounds, we've had to wait til now to get somewhere suitable and Oifuto (Dai Ni!!!!) has finally given us the chance. On the weekend of January 5th &amp; 6th, 2008, we will hold the New Year 7's and are hoping to attract 32 teams to enter.

						Some would say the &quot;luck of the Irish&quot; had something to do with the comeback the Celts pulled off at Misato, 0-3 down against YCAC with 10 minutes of the second half gone; who would have thought that the game could end in a draw. Today, there were no four leaf clovers or lucky leprechauns around, just some good old fashion grit, determination, strength of character, confidence &amp; team spirit from the lads to get back into a game that just ran away from us.<br>
						<br>
						Once again Celts were missing some regular first team players and having two players failing the early morning fitness test meant a mere 12 players available with two of them having just played 80 minutes in the earlier 2nd division game.. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season5/1014celts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
