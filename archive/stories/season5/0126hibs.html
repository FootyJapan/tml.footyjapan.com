									<p><b>Hodogaya Koen, Saturday 26th Jan</b>,<br>
										We were motivated after the loss at YCAC, and had nearly a full squad, everyone on time and ready to play. Unlike last week we came blazing out at the start, dominating the game immediately. We had several forays into their box, and then Andre had one of his great runs, beat his man and got chopped down for an early PK. He stepped up and hit a decent shot, but their keeper saved it and the momentum shifted.<br>
										<br>
										With Naoki out, we had changed our normal lineup and had some trouble getting ahold of the midfield, especially their number 29, a crafty and strong Japanese player. Eventually he sent a long cross from the left in to their tallish forward, which Jay left unmarked, his header went in off the post and gave Hitoshi no chance, 1-0 to the bad guys. We struck back almost immediately, this time Tomo had a great run from the right and burned a few players before getting hacked down for another PK. Another decent shot, but their goalie saved it again - then Andre to the rescue, he jumped in to score on the rebound, 1-1.<br>
										<br>
										They continued to give us problems in the midfield and after we broke down on the right and the ball was passed out to the top of the 18-yard box their midfielder hit a great shot that went in off the same post, 2-1 BEFC into half-time.<br>
										<br>
										We changed our lineup in the second half and went to a bigger midfield. The Hibs were dominating all over the pitch but BEFC dug in and we couldn't buy a goal - with 20 minutes left we started to throw everything forward - Andre had a great turn in the box but missed left, Jay had a good shot from the top of the box wide right, Tomo and Mike missed free kicks, their keeper made several saves. Finally Kuni, who had a very solid game, put a cross in which Mike took down beautifully off his chest, turned and fired home for the equalizer 2-2.<br>
										<br>
										They caught us on the counter as we pressed forward a few times in the second half, forcing Hitoshi into a sliding save at one point, but basically had two shots on goal the whole game, which both went in off the post. We were disappointed with the result and felt unlucky not to score again, but hats off to BEFC, they didn't back (or quiet) down..<br>
