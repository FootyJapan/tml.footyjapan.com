									<p><b>Todoroki, Monday 24th September</b>,<br>
										5-3, 3-3, 5-5 or 3-5?....... really, the score could have quite easily been any of the aforementioned, but unfortunately from the point of view of the red half of Tokyo, it was the first one (we&rsquo;ll consider it an away game due to how far the journey seemed on the train back after yet another lost game).<br>
										<br>
										With such an incident packed game it&rsquo;s hard to recount all the facts in detail but in general, BEFC started very strongly with everyone demanding the ball and pinning YCAC pretty much in their own half. A lovely slide-rule pass from Alex Babulall down the left sent Crouch onto the ball, holding off the last defender he let fly with a left-foot bullet that was heading into the top corner &#150; no really, it was - until Eddie ran across the face of goal to inadvertently block it with his body! (We&rsquo;ll forgive him though as he had a great game thereafter and scored a cracker when we were 2-1 down.) BEFC were playing well, stringing some nice passes together with confidence and seemed to be getting closer to the break through when YCAC mushroom-slapped us in the face with a devastating counter-attack to make it 1-0, totally against the run of play. But the heads stayed up and we got our reward with a Crouch low free kick under the YCAC &lsquo;jumping wall&rsquo; that the keeper tipped onto the post and out only for Silvano Borrrrrrrroooooni to respond quickest and prod home with the composure and calmness that belied his natural Italian emotions and get his first goal of the season. Other chances went begging throughout the half: Alex with a nice, mazy run and shot over, Eddie pulling a save from the keeper, Hal almost through for his first goal in BEFC colours, Taka Y with another shot over and another Crouch free kick arced over the wall, this time bouncing off the crossbar to safety. It wasn&rsquo;t all one-way traffic as this correspondent might have you believe though, and YCAC were very dangerous on the counter, playing early balls out to their left and right-backs and swiftly getting it up midfield into attack with some lovely passing play but not managing to convert it into shots at goal. Until of course they did and stunned us 2-1 going into the break. <br>
										<br>
										The second half was a little different as YCAC started to pin us in more often and won a lot of the 50/50 balls (they are very strong in the air) and played the ball around pretty nicely. However Eddie was in determined mood and looking to get his tally off the mark this season, snatched the ball off their snoozing defender, steamed forward and placed a cracker of a shot somewhere near the top left corner of the goal &#150; game back on. Another quick counter attack with Hal on the ball, bringing it forward and playing Crouch into the box to spin round and hammer a low shot in for his first goal of the season too. 3-2 up and thinking we only had about 5 minutes left to play, I was left shocked to hear the ref tell me there was another 18 to go. And so&#x2026;.. we battled hard, even had another gilt-edged chance with Borroni closing in on goal only to shoot off target. But perhaps we battled a little too hard with our fiery &lsquo;Will The Irish Barman&rsquo; appearing to rugby tackle their player in the box. A penalty was the correct decision (sorry Barman, but it was!) and they made no mistake to make it 3-3. Alright&#x2026;. 3-3, we could just about handle that. It would have been a bit harsh, but a draw wouldn&rsquo;t have been a completely unfair result for either team. However it was not to be as YCAC took advantage of their territorial play and exploited some of our defensive confusion to hit 2 goals past us in the space of as many minutes and effectively killed the game off. <br>
										<br>
										For the neutral observer it would have been a cracker to watch and to be honest, it was a good game to play in even though BEFC will surely rue the defensive errors that have cost them the chance for their first points on the table. The truth is that if we let 5 goals in, we don&rsquo;t deserve to win. That&rsquo;s not a sly at our defence at all, on the contrary the boys fought admirably, Rob and Ron in particular in their unfamiliar roles. But the fact is that we are probably feeling the pinch from the loss of last season&rsquo;s defensive linchpin, Capt Tim, who left Japan recently. It has meant the first three games this season have been with midfielders and even a striker filling in the back positions, so a special mention to those boys filling in for us there and putting the team ahead of personal glory. If we continue the way we are though, with the good attitude we&rsquo;re showing, then we&rsquo;ll start picking up some wins sooner rather than later. <br>
										<br>Fair play to YCAC too, we would normally expect a bit more verbal grief and moaning from them but they seem to have cooled it a bit since last time we played them (in last year&rsquo;s Plate semi-final that we won 3-1 incidentally &#150; sorry fella&rsquo;s, had to mention it as we don&rsquo;t have a lot to shout about down these ways recently!). They were strong, competitive and fair and made it a really good, tough, proper game to play in. Final shout goes to our ref, SL, who controlled it well and had a good game too.<br>
