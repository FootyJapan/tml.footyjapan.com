									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 17th May</b>,<br>
										The Saitama Jets managed to finish a torrid season on a positive note as they were at last able to record a victory over one of their relegation rivals and offer themselves a hope of staying up, albeit dependant on other results.  <br>
										<br>
										The Jets started the game well and found themselves two up within the first ten minutes.  First, Hayashi&rsquo;s pinpoint cross picked out Nate Gildart as he ghosted between two defenders and the Canadian marksman was under no pressure as he placed a free header to the goalkeeper&rsquo;s left. <br>
										1-0 Jets.  Then, just minutes later, Yoshi Ozawa&rsquo;s free kick from near flag was met by Mark Eite&rsquo;s glancing header at the near post and the ball flew into the roof of the net for the Jets&rsquo; captain&rsquo;s first goal of the season.<br>
										<br>
										The Vags tried to pick themselves up and they saw plenty of the ball, but despite some decent passing moves were unable to fashion a clear-cut opportunity as through balls too often skipped off the slick surface for a goal kick or were picked off by the Saitama &lsquo;keeper and defence.  They were also playing a dangerous game at the back, knocking square passes across the pitch which Gildart and, in particular Ryan Loren, were constantly looking to intercept.  The third goal on the stroke of half time came about when the Vags got themselves into a spot of bother and were forced to knock it back to the &lsquo;keeper &#150; who wasn&rsquo;t actually there as he had come to the edge of the area and then was forced to race back to clear the ball off the line as an own goal threatened.  The ball went straight back to the Jets and eventually to Ozawa who took one touch and sent the ball 25 yards over the hapless goalie and into the net for a 3-0 halftime lead.<br>
										<br>
										The Vags came out in the second half and determined not to give up on what seemed a lost cause, but were still having trouble penetrating the Saitama back line.  However they pulled one back when their striker let fly from 20 yards and sent the ball unerringly into the far bottom corner.  3-1 Jets.  But any glimmer of hope was quickly extinguished when more suicidal play at the back allowed Loren to intercept the ball and get one-on-one with the keeper, who made a good save from the American&rsquo;s first effort but could do nothing as the Jets&rsquo; striker regained the ball and unselfishly squared it for Kikuchi to side foot home for his customary goal and to restore Saitama&rsquo;s three goal advantage, 4-1.<br>
										<br>
										Sasaki&rsquo;s late sending off for retaliation was a concern, particularly as the Vags took instant advantage to make the score 4-2, but with just minutes to play the Jets saw out the game for a crucial victory.  The result relegated the Vagabonds after a single season in the top flight and Saitama could well join them if the British Embassy can avoid defeat to the much improved Kanto Celts, who could finish as high as fourth this season.  Come on you Celts!<br>
