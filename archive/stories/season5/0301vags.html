									<p><b>OiFuto Dirt Saturday 1st March</b>,<br>
										Vags vs. Hibs, 1-1<br>
										First Person, Free Verse  Report by a Cheeky 'Keeper<br>
										<br>
										Pregame:<br>
										Sunny, windy Saturday afternoon.<br>
										Gary talking about &quot;Anxiety of Influence&quot; by Bloom.<br>
										Alex holding the autobio-tome of Re'chilli's Anthony.<br>
										Graham giving the finer points of the street game Curbee.<br>
										Half our players went to the wrong Nishi Oi<br>
											due to template paste job, yeah, they almost late.<br>
										Now Bob Marley: &quot;Oi yoi yoi, oi yoi yoi yoi, o yoi yoi yoi yoi yoi yoi yoi.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										We were lacking:<br>
										Lyndsey (in Hawaii)<br>
										Simon (groin)<br>
										A-chan &amp; Francis (Vaga burnout?)<br>
										Stevie (care for family in Brittany)<br>
										&amp; Eric Ling (wife in hospital, badda bing).<br>
										<br>
										Kick Off:<br>
										From your truly crazy keeper, the rousing &quot;Let's tie these guys.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										First half:<br>
										As is our forte, first ten-minute sexy subtlety:<br>
										Alex and Paul dinging back &amp; forth, from left to center through the froth<br>
										of a sleepy looking Hibs back half, no chance for Hitoshi:<br>
										blistering Alex shot just above the keeper, Vags one, Hibs nashi.<br>
										From my keeper-centric perspective:<br>
										futsal training key, as John's shout to get out<br>
										rang solidy, so at the edge blocking a yabai one and one;<br>
										before, even tho called offsides, could get a hand on a Tomo lob,<br>
										but coulda done better w/ a high catchable shot, just tipped over;<br>
										once i came out and missed their forward run, our D cleared the lines:<br>
										gassho guys, zero-one for Vagabonds.<br>
										<br>
										Second half:<br>
										All that body healing, weight training, yoga &amp; massages paid off<br>
										yet it was really our whole team digging in, hats off.<br>
										The Hibs were waking and taking it to us, but other than one<br>
										dangerous side cracker shot saved with my diving left tit <br>
										it seemed like we could win as Nao, Chris, Graham, Paul! &amp; Ged held<br>
										&amp; occasional dashes forth by John &amp; Alex seemed potential.<br>
										The corners were coming in fast and heavy, and from one of these<br>
										from twenty five yards out, a smashing, killer volley, left me on my heels<br>
										&amp; Graham on a height diet, could only head it in our corner net, my bad.<br>
										From then it was Ged's toxic invective that made us fight harder<br>
										(but against us or against them is ponderable).<br>
										In spite of playing better than usual, i still should have caught a cross<br>
										but punched it...i could hear somebody say &quot;my grandma could punch harder&quot;<br>
										&amp; realized to my dismay, it was my own mate!<br>
										With power and funky bounces, a few shots were dangerously, uhm, right to me.<br>
										Out another of their corners, managed to make a low, point blank save with legs,<br>
										only for the rebound to be found, booted &amp; bound off the bar, ah, third hand!<br>
										A grungy, physical, verbal go in &quot;old&quot; Vagabond mode which may well bode<br>
										if we keep this up, we'll stay up in this division &amp; then some. <br>
