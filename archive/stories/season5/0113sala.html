									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 13th January</b>,<br>
										The New Year festivities over and done with, the weekly routine back into play, resolutions made and it was now time to blow the holiday cobwebs away and get back into winning ways.  On a bitterly cold evening in Saitama the Sala men reconvened.<br>
										<br>
										Spirits were high as one by one, two by two the men trickled through the ticket barriers at the venue station.  Hand shakes, happy New Year greetings and small talk about the holidays followed.  Even pleasantries exchanged between opposing team members were witnessed, personally speaking this was an uncomfortable experience.  The subject in question soon turned, first to how the temperature was comparable to the summit of Mt Fuji to more importantly the task in hand, were we fit? Were we strong? <br>
										<br>
										The pitch, although artificial, couldn&rsquo;t have been more different to the torrid conditions encountered at the Misato dustbowl a month earlier.  Flat, true and wide.  Quick, direct passing was the key, the use of width which we had in abundance and the utilisation of space would all play and important part in determining the result.  <br>
										<br>
										YCAC were an unknown quantity in many respects.  They were able to prove themselves convincingly at the 7s championship just 2 weeks prior with an impressive tournament victory and many if not all were present for the Sala appointment.  However, taking past experience into account they had been known to suffer in terms of weekly personnel consistency.  <br>
										<br>
										The general consensus before the game was to play against the wind in the first half, a decision which may have been overlooked if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the lingering bitter taste of the Hibs catastrophe.  This proved to be a mitigating factor as play was largely surface based from both teams from the offset and Sala took advantage with some positive precision passing.<br>
										<br>
										From the whistle Sala made their intentions clear by keeping possession and making the YCAC team work for the ball.  Play was heavily concentrated on the left hand-side within the opening minutes with Lenny and Masa linking up dangerously with some neat ground passing to feet.  <br>
										The first real chances of the game fell to Sala early on with efforts from Brooke, Masa and Doughal being safely dealt with by the YCAC keeper.  Stubborn defending from a back line which consisted a delicate balance of youth and experience contained the Sala threats on goal largely to the penalty box and beyond.<br>
										<br>
										Sam once again proved his worth with some excellent movement on the right showing determination and cut throat ruthlessness to get behind the YCAC full back.  His efforts were partially suspended on about 18 minutes when a slightly agitated and frustrated YCAC midfielder claimed his stakes for ill-timed tackle of the year, sithing down Sam and almost ending his participation in proceedings.  This only triggered a surge from Sala with Brooke linking up on 2 or 3 occasions with the Sala strike force of Dhugal and Toby to create openings for Masa and Dan on the overlapping runs.  <br>
										<br>
										The deadlock was nearly quite literally smashed midway through the first half after a brilliantly executed ball from Lenny into Toby&rsquo;s feet just outside the 18 yard box.  A beautifully timed diverting run from Dhugal opened the space for Toby to turn and shoot only to see his effort rattle against the crossbar.  <br>
										<br>
										With the opening half drawing to a close, the Sala central defence consisting of Ian and Yusuke continued to maintain their vice like grip on the YCAC stike partnership who rarely had a chance to turn and catch a glimpse of Sid between the posts let alone shoot at him.  Intricate, short passing among the YCAC midfield provided a rare opening late on in the 1st half only to be quelled once again by a tireless, well disciplined Sala back four.<br>
										<br>
										Sala returned in the 2nd half with an unchanged team with both subs on imminent standby.  The re-start mirrored the opening moments of the game, fast, aggressive and direct but clear cut chances had dried up for Sala and it became obvious that YCAC were now setting the pace to suit their defensive strategy.<br>
										On 51 minutes the YCAC &lsquo;destroyer&rsquo; as he&rsquo;d probably like to be known was forcefully challenged inside the centre-circle by an unknown Sala midfielder.  The fall resulted in a slight blow to the left shoulder complimented by some moaning, lying on the ground and general complaining.  His post-tantrum departure paved the way for a far more threatening player.  The change in personnel added to the physical battle in midfield which proved a handful for both Brooke and Pete.<br>
										<br>
										The resulting change in dynamics to the game prompted a Sala response with the introduction of Scotty to the centre of midfield who immediately rose to the occasion with some very accomplished first touches.  Brooke was moved out to the wing and once again the tempo was raised and Sala began their second surge.<br>
										<br>
										The concentration and stamina of the YCAC back line were constantly tested by the Sala strike partnership and on several occasions they were able to break lose and get beyond the full backs who were sinking deeper and deeper into their own half.  By-line crosses were deflected for corners which on their delivery proved fruitless as the YCAC doggedly defended their goal.  Nervous thoughts of a dreary, deflating 0 - 0 draw were creeping into the minds of all Sala players and as the time ticked, the steely determination of the opposition began to prove this depressing premonition.  <br>
										<br>
										Some neat play on left by Masa and Lenny culminated in some excellent one touch passing into Toby and Dhugal&rsquo;s feet who on receiving took advantage of the fatigued YCAC defence.  They, on several occasions were able to switch the play and open up the right flank for Pete, Brooke and Dan to attack the YCAC right side.  On 65 minutes the ball was played into Scotty who carefully sliced a one touch chip over the defence into the path of Brooke who happened to be in the vicinity.  On realising he may actually have a chance of getting there and after a few choice words about Scotty&rsquo;s lofted pass as opposed to a grounded one, the captain put in a valiant 5 yard dash, the resulting player/keeper &lsquo;mash up&rsquo; inflicting a game ending injury to the keeper.  The experienced YCAC central defender, also father and mentor to their up and coming 12 year old striker stepped in and the already frail YCAC defence took another blow.<br>
										<br>
										Soon after the re-start, calm possession and patience on the right wing between Doughal and Brooke gave soon to be married Dan the opportunity to exploit his attacking instincts.  His subsequent drive forward was complimented by a nicely cushioned lay-off by Doughal after a first-time pass from Brooke.  This resulted in a beautifully timed hanging cross to the back post which was met by Toby after a gracious leap to beat his man.  His header was meticulously guided towards Pete who shrugged off his marker to convert on the volley from 9 yards.  <br>
										<br>
										Wise words from Clarkey along the lines of &lsquo;stay focused, don&rsquo;t stop playing, don&rsquo;t panic&rsquo; were uttered and almost the complete opposite ensued.  Another, less constructive quote was to be heard soon after, &lsquo;why have we suddenly turned to shit?!&rsquo; The &lsquo;turning to shit&rsquo; summing up our immediate response to the lead.  It was time for his introduction and the highly effective and composed Dan was rested for Clarkey to slot in. His leadership made an immediate impact and after some important interceptions by Ian and level-headedness under pressure by Sid, order was once again restored.<br>
										<br>
										The final period of the match saw some powerful surges forward by YCAC&rsquo;s recently introduced central midfielder, his strength in the air releasing the young forward who proved menacing at times.  Nonetheless, it was Sala who found the net again. Yusuke, now filling in at right back saw the diagonal run made by Dhugal who was obviously determined to get on the score sheet.  The pass soared above the retreating central defence and into the path of Dougal already in full flow.  His first touch took him wide of the oncoming keeper but with an exquisitely cool head he was able to finish superbly from a difficult angle, the ball nestled safely in the bottom right corner. 2 &#150; 0 and game over.<br>
										<br>
										The Sala victory was hard-fought and deserved with periods of sublime one-touch high tempo passing.  Every player delivered at crucial moments and it was the positive attitude in all areas that prevailed and secured the 3 points.  <br>
