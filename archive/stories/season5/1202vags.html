									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 2nd</b>,<br>
										Vagabonds lost 2-0 to Kanto Celts between 10am and 12pm today. It has to be considered one of the poorest Vags performances of the season yielding a record number of injuries, about 6 players, and culminating in a reservoir dogs like bloody final scene in the Celts six yard box. <br>
										<br>
										Still the Celts required a deflection in the first half and a speculative long distance punt in the second to take the points, while vagabonds improvised a makeshift opposition which, had it succeeded in earning us points &#150; and it very nearly did &#150; wouldn't have been brag worthy.<br>
										<br>
										It might have occurred to somebody following the Vagabonds fortunes of late that they have turned their season around and developed a formula for earning points. Then again it might not. But today, it was obvious that we had indeed found a formula (confidential of course) that was corrupted by the unfortunate events in this game.<br>
										<br>
										Celts are not dirty but they did us damage, physically today. Early knocks for Ged and Gary ended or diminished their participation then later knocks for Brian M, Wayne and Alex S shook them out of their stride. Paul missed the first half and never really got into the game when he stepped out second half. Muzzy never showed up at all. <br>
										The remaining players carried the Vagabonds and kept the score respectable, especially Lindsay, Steve, Simon and Nao. <br>
										<br>
										I`m reluctant to give much detail about today, a mild PTSD from the horror of the game and the Claret ending the reason perhaps, or the after game box of Chablis which made it all seem so long ago and out of context. <br>
										<br>
										Last 5 minutes Steve stormed forward and we won a couple of corners. The last one spun through the Celts Keeper`s hands and as both he and the fumbled ball fell towards Gary Quinn`s deadly left foot the goalie embraced Quinn not unlovingly but quite illegally around the waist but it slipped the Referee`s attention. A melee followed, the ball struck the Celts cross bar and something hard struck Simon Sparkes above the right temple breaking open a gash and making a mess of half a dozen jerseys. He was ambulanced away for treatment. Whether the brainbox will still be able to do the Times crossword in 20 minutes remains to be seen, but so long as he is back for next Saturday`s game &#150; along with Wayne who hopefully can glue his missing tooth back in place - the rest of us will be relieved. As for the rest of the injured players from today: get well soon.<br>
