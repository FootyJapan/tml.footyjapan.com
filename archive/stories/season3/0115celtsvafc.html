								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 15th January.</b> On a beautiful day in Hachioji Park, the Celts made up for a  disappointing loss in the FJ Cupa number of weeks ago to the AFC Wanderers. <br>
									The game started of with both sides trying to find their feet, with AFC finding theirs the quickest, putting our flanks under pressure AFC broke on a counter and slotted the ball in for an early lead. The Celts battled back into the game and soon equalized through our leading lady Frau Oliver!! A superb through ball from Magoo sent the hungover striker powering into the area to slot into the corner! This continues Ollie&rsquo;s league leading scoring streak before a dubious AFC challenge sent him for an early shower.<br>
									The Celts started dominating the game with the midfield stringing together a good passing game.<br>
									Our new wunderkind, Soh began to dominate up front, holding up the ball well and turning his man at every opportunity! He scored a fine strike from outside the area and Dermot (I have missed one penalty)Hanlon stroked home a penalty which just beat the keeper! Roberto Zirilli was introduced on the wing and made an immediate impact with some excellent passing and mazy runs.<br>
									The two Ben&rsquo;s at the heart of defence were solid, as were Gus and Seamus , Taka and Fumi on the wings were an effective alternative to attacking through the centre. Up front the new partnership of Soh and Olli were excellent.<br>
									The second half AFC came out and pushed the Celts back for the first 10 minutes with there NO.24 causing a few problems. Another goal from Soh and a well taken volley from Ben Reeder from a corner saw the game finish 5-1 to the Celts. Andy, Terry, Eugene and John Conama all proved excellent when introduced but a special mention is left for super sub Thierry Hatchell! His runs and cheeky nutmegs caused havoc in the AFC defense when he was introduced; a dubious offside decision and a ridiculous miss prevented him from putting his name on the goal sheet!<br>
									A well deserved victory for the Celts which sees the Celts top of the league.<br>
