								<p><b>OiFuto Sat 26th November.</b> Before this game a minutes silence was  held in honour of the great, late George Best and the loss to the footballing  world was there for all to see.&nbsp; However, if Georgie was watching this  fixture from the heavens above he would have been either turning in his grave  or taking to the bottle again.<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									This was a scrappy Division 2 affair  with little flair, style or panache.&nbsp; Only flashes of silky football  appeared in this drab encounter and most of it came from the young Copel side that fully deserved their victory. &nbsp;<br>
									Copel striker number 13 (lucky for  some) grabbed a quick fire second-half goal to ensure Copel denied a desperate  BEFC victory at Oi Futo. <br>
									Both sides had early chances but it was Copel&rsquo;s number 18 who broke the dead-lock when he headed in a right-wing cross just midway  through the first half.<br>
									Tim Letheren looked to have saved the Embassy boys from their third successive loss when he headed in a left-wing cross with half an  hour still remaining.<br>
									Striker 13 then broke away moments later and sank BEFC hearts with a clinical finish past Keith Crowley, having shrugged off a determined challenge by Mike  Yeomans.<br>
									Copel look a reasonable 2nd Division outfit,  young, skillful, fast and clinical at times. &nbsp;Poor old BEFC must be wondering where their next victory will come from and despite all their endeavors,  have a chance to make amends in the league against Vagabonds on December 11th.  However, next up for the boys in red are France FC in the Footy Japan Cup and  they must be praying to the gods for an upset next Saturday.&nbsp;<br>
