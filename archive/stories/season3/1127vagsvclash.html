								<p><b>Misato ASG Sun 27th November.</b> Some players are born great, some have greatness thrust upon them, and then there are guys who turn up late, hungover, in a foul temper, then get a jammy break of the ball in the box and smack home the winner. Such was the fate of Andy Drought in Sunday's Clash versus Vagabonds fixture at Misato.<br>
									<br>This was a dire game of football. Both teams huffed and puffed to produce misplaced passes and scuffed attempts at goal. Clash forward John withdrew midway through the first half with a fractured leg, an injury in which, incredible as it seems, Vagabond thuggery was not a factor. <br>
									Clash had the better chances, with midfielders Ken, Dave and Chris constantly harrassing the Vags off the ball. However, Vags keeper Taylor was confident in his handling, but had Clash forward Alec had his shooting boots on in the final 20 minutes when clear on the keeper twice, the scoreline might have been more decisive. <br>
									As for tghe Vagabonds, they failed to produce a single attempt on target during the whole 80 minutes. No doubt that was the referee's fault, because every misfortune, in Vagsyland, seems to be the referee's fault. The goal that separated the teams, a mix of good fortune and sublime skill, came early in the second half. Andy Drought powered into the box, opponents and alcohol fumes trailing in his wake, and got the break of the ball off a defender. He still had a lot to do and the chip over the keeper was inch-perfect. <br>
									<br>
									This was the first Clash goal from open play in four games. Clash have put in better performances and come away with less, so it was a good day for them. As for Vags, their captain commented at the end, They were shit, and we were bloody awful. Well, to paraphrase Churchill, Clash will be sober next week, and Vags will probably still be bloody awful.<b><br>
