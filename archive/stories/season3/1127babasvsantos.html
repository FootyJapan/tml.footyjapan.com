								<p><b>Todoroki Sun 27th November.</b> Barbarians again fielded a strong team for their 5th TML game of the 05/06 campaign and with 3 wins out of 4 were looking much better positioned than last year. A win would bring them up to 2nd in the table, their highest ever position in the league.<br>
									<br>
									In goal for the Barbarians was Fred, leaving Seno to fill his place in central midfield alongside Fergs, Hideki &amp; Austin completed the defence, midfield was John Mac, John Stokes, Rouven &amp; Muramoto, with Danny &amp; Mark up front. On the bench were Jimmy, Jaffa, Richard &amp; Hussein, team changes being marshalled by our injured Geordie Clarke<br>
									<br>
									Barbs started well and pushed forward regularly in the first 15 minutes. Mark had probably the best chance of the opening period with a shot against the upright. Santos were defending well and looking to play on the break, with a couple of useful forwards they always looked dangerous when they did get the ball. Plenty of attacking play by both sides meant for an exciting first half, the best chance of the period coming to Santos when 2 attackers beat the offside trap and homed in on goal, Fred came out, stood up well and pressurised the attacker into passing the ball instead of taking the shot, resulting in an offside call rather than a goal. A similar move close to half time again saw Fred off his line quickly pressurising the Santos forward to shoot wide from another dangerous position. Half time saw the two teams head in level at 0 - 0 but goals looked likely in the second half<br>
									<br>
									Barbs came out quicker in the second half and had a couple of early chances and put pressure on Santos with 2 or 3 corners. Breakthrough came when Mark chased after a beautifully flighted free kick from Fergs deep in the BaBas half, beating the defender to it and the fast charging goalie, he lifted the ball high over the keeper looping it in just under the bar to give BaBas the lead. Soon after Santos had a chance to level the scores but again their finishing let them down. BaBas continued to press and a dangerous cross from the right looked to have been handled in the box, the ref immediately pointed to the spot but after consultation with the Santos linesman it was agreed that the shoulder extended to the elbow and a corner was given instead. From the corner the ball was scrambled out to the edge of the penalty area, Mark fired in a shot which beat the keeper but was handled on the line. This time there was no doubt and no protests, Santos were reduced to 10 men and Jaffa slotted the spot kick home to give the Barbs a bit of breathing space<br>
									<br>
									Santos pushed for a goal to try and get back into the game but with only 10 men they were going to be further exposed at the back. Jaffa almost made it three with a superb freekick which thundered against the bar. Soon after Richard chased down a long ball to the goal line, instead of clearing for a corner the Santos defender pushed it back high into the box where Danny with a reflex header somehow managed to loop the ball in over the keeper to the top corner for an unlikely third goal. Barbarians finished things off completely when Mark slipped thru the defence and coolly side-footed his shot past the keeper for his second of the game and Barbarians 4th. Final score Barbarians 4 Santos 0<br>
