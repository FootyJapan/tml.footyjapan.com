								<p><b>Todoroki, Sunday 11th June.</b> The Saitama Jets wrapped up the Division Two title with a comfortable 4-1 win over a useful Shane side. The goals came from Keating, and, predictably, Loren, Gildart and Garner. There were other chances to add to the lead, but in rotten conditions, the Jets hot-shots were unable to take advantage.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									Both&nbsp;teams entered the game with something to prove. Shane had a reputation for a mean defence, with only 8 goals conceded in 12 games. They had also held the Celts and Stoneds to draws in recent weeks, confirming that they are one of the strongest sides in the division. The Jets were champions-elect, and had the best goal-scoring record in Division Two with 41 goals from 12 games. In a battle between defence and attack, it was the penetrating thrust of the Jets which won out.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The first goal came after a sublime bit of skill in the mud from quick-footed Rob Keating. He picked up the ball on the left, meandered through a couple of challenges and a puddle bigger than my bath, before hitting a low shot which the keeper could only parry into the roof of the net. The next 2 Jets goals came in quick succession, and both owed a great deal to the accurate corner-taking of Tomo Kobayashi. The first was played in low, and hit perfectly on the volley by American striker Ryan Loren for his 9th TML goal. Shortly after, another Kobayashi corner found Garner lurking at the far post. His downward header was cleared off the line, but only as far as the waiting Nate Gildart, who pounced for his 10th league goal of the season. There were other chances, with a couple of long shots from Garner and Keating not troubling the keeper, and Canadian Gildart firing just wide after jinking his way into the box cleverly. On the break, Shane had speed and skill, but their forays forward were generally dealt with well by the solid Jets defence of Rayner, Bentz, Frenchman Hembise and Chunky Robinson. When Shane did threaten, Harada stood strong in the Jets goal.<br>
									<br>
									In the second half, it was more of the same really, as Gildart, Garner and Loren looked for goals, and the Jets generally overwhelmed the tiring Shane team. The goals did not flow as easily, however, and Shane began to look more likely to score on the break. One defensive error was covered up with a fine save by keeper Fraser Gould, but he could do little a few minutes later, when a move broke down in midfield and Shane attackers outnumbered Jets defenders. Ali for Shane tucked away a close-range effort to make it 3-1. As the Jets pushed for more goals, Deryk Bliss created a chance. His ball into the area found Garner running on to it, and he chested the high pass beyond the last defender. He was abruptly pulled down into the mud from behind, and even Ruari's green-and-white hooped glasses couldn't blind him to the foul. Rather than do the decent thing and let Gildart take the penalty, Garner greedily took it himself, bringing his tally for the season to nine.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									There were other chances, but the last major incident of the game was a nasty injury to the Shane keeper. He was hurt in an accidental collision with Gildart, and taken off to the hospital with a bit of a concussion and at least one lost tooth. All of the Jets wish him a speedy recovery.<br>
									<br>
									===<br>
									<br>
									So, a season which started with a thumping 5-1 win over the Celts ended with an equally-convincing victory over one of the other title contenders. The Jets are proud to be the only unbeaten team in both divisions of the TML. There were definitely some hairy moments along the way, and the draws against the Vags and Wall Street were only secured with last-minute penalties. The Jets look forward to the challenge of playing at a higher level, and hopefully establishing ourselves in the first division.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The team bids farewell to two veterans this season, as Chunky Matt Robinson and Gary Garner hang up their boots. Chunk is returning to the UK to serve a master...sorry, get a Masters, while Garner's family commitments mean he will no longer be able to play at weekends.<br>
