								<p><b>OiFuto dirt, Sat 28th January.</b> British  Embassy&rsquo;s improving run of form continued as they frustrated Mauritzio  at Oi Futo to record their third draw of the season. <br>
									Mauritzio produced most of the attacking football in the first half, but failed to even deliver a serious shot on target. British  Embassy for all their efforts weren&rsquo;t much better.<br>
									Embassy&rsquo;s Steve Lidbury and Tetsuo also failed to convert decent chances in the first  half.<br>
									BEFC offered more after the break, and came close to scoring when Kotaro unleashed a dipping shot that cannoned off the cross bar.&nbsp;<br>
									Mauritzio almost stole the points at the death, when  their striker cut inside the penalty box from the right and curled a goal  bound shot towards the far left corner, only to find the superb Keith Crowley finger tip it round the post.<br>
									Man of the match &#150; Keith Crowley &#150; Was only called upon once, but was there when  needed.<br>
