					<h1 class="red">Babas See Off Weakened Stoneds</h1>
										<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sat 17th December.</b> On a great sunny, but cold day, Barbarians and Stoneds faced off for what was going to be one of the more important games in the Barbs season.<br>
											<br>
											Great news came early on when the Ref. asked if Barbarians could supply an extra linesman as the Stoneds had only 9 players. The Barbs were happy to oblige. <a class="txlink" href="1217barbarvsto.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>

								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 11th December.</b> The cold, bitter wind blows hard, the AFC number 9 hunched over, hands on his knees, gasping for air looks round at his team mates as if to say &quot;I have no more to give&quot;. It is an hour before kick off and AFC are making their way up the steep hill towards YCAC. Somewhere between hammered and hangover, Olly is starting to regret an ill-advised night out in Roppongi! <a class="txlink" href="1211ycacvafc.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>

							<p><b>Big Circus, Sun 11th December.</b> British Embassy finally got their act together having not won a fixture since their opening 1-0 win over Wall Street Clash FC in September.&nbsp; In fact, both BEFC and Vagabonds misfortunes have run parallel this season with both sides on only 5 points a piece and struggling in a competitive 2nd Division.&nbsp; So, this game was either going to be a drab draw or a complete goal fest. <a class="txlink" href="1211befcvvags.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>

						<h1 class="navy">Hungover Clash Grab Draw from Maritizio</h1>
						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 11th December.</b> This was a game of contrasting styles, both sartorial and footballing. If Eminem and Da Pump formed a football team, it would be Maritizio. However, their baggy long pants and cute line in knitted bobble caps flatters to deceive - these boys can play a bit. As for Clash, they thought it couldn&sbquo;t get worse than having a fixture the day after the Bonenkai - until Ken turned up with the kit. He had been told to wash it, but apparently, no one thought to tell him you need to dry it, too. Damp, cold and hungover, Clash squidged onto the Hachioji turf to do battle. <a class="txlink" href="1211clashvmaritizio.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 4th December.</b> At an Extraordinary General Meeting on Sunday night at YC&amp;AC, the Club Members voted to go ahead with the installation of an artificial grass pitch and floodlights. Construction is scheduled to start in early April and finish in September of 2006.<a class="txlink" href="1204clashvcopel.html" target="_blank"><br>

					<h1 class="navy">Copel Flair Equal to Clash Muscle</h1>
					<p><b>OiFuto Astro, Sun 4th December.</b> Wall Street Clash with a mixed team chiefly English but also featuring some quality Japanese players, a couple of North Americans, stoutly skippered by a moustachioed 1920s throwback captain, Ian Wing Commander Webster, aren't doing too badly so far this season. Today a 3-3 draw meant they had not lost since their opening fixture. In a game against new boys to the league, Copel FC, who have earned some decent reviews, not even their own player manager expected them to get much. However, on a big, wet Oifuto surface they managed to take the lead three times against their fitter and more technically gifted opponents and hold it at halftime. <a class="txlink" href="1204clashvcopel.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>
