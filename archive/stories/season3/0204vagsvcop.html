								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 4th February.</b> On Saturday afternoon,Vagabonds recorded their first real win of the season.(The first was by default when the opposition didn't muster enough troops )<br>
									<br>In a six pointer against fellow strugglers Copel F.C. a game of fluctuating fortunes finally went the Vags way. Copel took the lead early on but Vags' heads didn't drop in anticipation of yet another defeat since we had a feeling that we could get back into the game.This we did in some style with three first half goals through Wayne, Dave Ainsley and Lindsay. Dave's goal was clearly offside but since it was their linesman who didn't flag we didn't feel too guilty about taking it although the mind boggles at what the probable reaction would have been if it had been Copel scoring a clearly offside goal with their own linesman! I have to confess that we would probably have reacted rather badly so full credit to Copel for just getting on with the game.<br>
									<br>
									And get on with the game they did. They certainly had the better of the second half but our defence held firm until with just a couple of minutes to go and Vags down to ten men since Timo had had to go off with a groin strain - a common Vags injury these days ,it seems- they pulled a goal back. But  a little too late so a long overdue victory for the basement dwellers who are now looking to pull up and away into the comfort zone of mid-table.<br>
