								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 28th January.</b> BFC showed strength, resolve and spirit to come back from 0-2 against the Swiss Kickers at Hachioji Park on Saturday evening.&nbsp;Already&nbsp;two behind at half time having for the most part been outfought and outplayed by a&nbsp;disciplined Swiss side, a much improved second half performance featured a comeback game, a goal of the season contender, a&nbsp;performance of the season display from Jyrki in goal, and certainly a debut not to be forgotten for Momo, BFC's newest recruit.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Starting with a couple of enforced changes to the side that&nbsp;narrowly failed to beat Jetro&nbsp;in the snow the week before, BFC found themselves under early pressure. You can always bank on the Swiss to play a very direct style, and the early&nbsp;pressure paid&nbsp;dividends with veteran Karl Hahne taken down&nbsp;in the box by Dave Long. The penalty dispatched low and under Beef Jyrki handed the Swiss the lead.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									BFC toiled but lacked composure and seemingly the willingness to&nbsp;be creative going forward, leaving the&nbsp;two strikers little chance of unlocking the tightly wound Swiss defence. Too often they were left&nbsp;chasing hopeful punts rather than precise passes.&nbsp; The&nbsp;pressure from the Swiss continued and with BFC&nbsp;looking&nbsp;rattled,&nbsp;a loose ball landed at JP's feet some 25 yards from goal.&nbsp;With his back to goal and more space than he expected, the unassuming Swiss midfielder simply spun and hooked the ball high into the  Hachioji night and was as surprised as the rest of us when it landed in the back of the BFC net. 2-0 Swiss and things looking very bleak.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									It hadn't&nbsp;all been poor from BFC, with some reasonable spells of pressure testing the stand in Swiss keeper. Tom - out of position on the left - Jon, Pabs and Tesco Mark playing his first game since returning from his honeymoon, all showed flashes of form. Pink Neil kept the corners coming, and Ryo supplied some decent crosses, but&nbsp;BFC lacked the final touch, and were for the most part all too quiet.&nbsp;Brian D's somewhat aimless run through the middle before losing control of the ball rather taking the&nbsp;easy&nbsp;pass&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;to sum&nbsp;up the first half.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									A few words at halftime, a change seeing debutant Momo replacing Brian D in the middle, and a&nbsp;more determined side took&nbsp;to the field. Momo&nbsp;immediately made an impact,&nbsp;comfortable on the ball and assured in the tackle he quickly settled into the game.&nbsp; Ryo, after&nbsp;some polite discussion with the Swiss left back over the unfortunate result of his previous attempted cross, continued to surge forward. With the Swiss rattled,&nbsp;15 minutes into the second half, the ball&nbsp;found its way&nbsp;over from the right, and up popped the mercurial Pink Neil at the back post to put it&nbsp;away. 1-2 and BFC were deservedly back in the match.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Another change saw Al return to action after a lengthy lay off with injury. Tom made way, with Pink dropping deeper on the left and the tall chap heading up front.&nbsp; BFC poured forward seeking the equalizer, at times leaving gaps behind the midfield. But the impressive defensive line of&nbsp;Dave, Phil and Leigh proved more than a match for the Swiss forwards, and when they were beaten, Man Mountain Jyrki stood in their way.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Then came BFC's goal of the season candidate. Mark R won the ball in midfield and fed it towards Al who with a flick, found Jon on the edge of the left hand side of the penalty area.&nbsp;With the&nbsp;ball on the up, Jon unleashed a venomous shot with his LEFT boot which saw&nbsp;it&nbsp;zip into the top right hand&nbsp;corner of the goal. 2-2.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The action was not to stop there, as debutant Momo was on the receiving end of a&nbsp;strong&nbsp;challenge from the excellent Swiss midfielder and took matters into his own hands. Or head as it turned out. Pietro was on the spot and showed both players a red card - a touch unfortunate for the Swiss player - with both players now set to serve a game suspension. Add getting hopelessly lost on his way to the ground, and an injury to his red card and you have a game that Momo won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The Swiss will point to at least three outstanding point blank second saves from Jyrki denying them victory, but BFC can be very proud of the performance in the second half of this match.&nbsp; With&nbsp;more players back from injury/work commitments,&nbsp;we can look forward to&nbsp;take a strong, in-form&nbsp;squad into the three league games in February. Next up, YCAC....<br>
