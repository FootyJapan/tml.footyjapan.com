								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 12th March.</b>  A Ryan Loren double helped the Saitama Jets continue their relentless march towards the first division with an efficient, if far from spectacular, 4-0 win over the YCAC 2nds. On a bumpy pitch, with a gale-force wind blowing, this was not a game for the football purist, but Loren's two first-half goals were complemented by Chris Piper's first league goal and an unbelievable own goal to give the Jets a comfortable victory. <br>
									<br>
									 Playing the YCAC 2nd team is a somewhat unnerving experience. Half the team is made up of players who are clearly nearing the end of their careers. The other half of their team is young and hungry. This leaves opposing teams with the difficult task of dealing with the pace of the young whipper-snappers, and the physical strength and experience of some of the YCAC veterans. The Jets would have some problems with the unusual balance of the YCAC team, especially in the second half. <br>
									<br>
									 In the first half, however, the Jets started well. Ryan Loren was looking dangerous on the left side, and Mark Eite and Nate Gildart were looking fresh and raring to go. Sasaki and Keating in the centre of midfield were also seeing a lot of the ball. A couple of half-chances were created early on, but the men from Saitama were unable to capitalize on their possession, and the first clear chance went to the home side. A floated ball over the top sailed with the wind, and was reached first by a YCAC midfielder bursting through. Kosuke Harada in the Jets goal came off his line, and the YCAC player chose to lob him. The shot beat the keeper, but the ever-reliable Simon Bentz raced back to head off the line. Almost first blood to YCAC. <br>
									<br>
									 The Jets then opened the scoring, thanks to the work of the most prolific strike partnership in the second division. Garner's punt was aimed at Loren, but got caught in the wind, and Nate Gildart was left in a chase with the onrushing goalkeeper. He won, and nodded the ball over the goalie. With a YCAC defender trying to 'do a Bentz' and clear, Loren followed up and tapped the ball into the empty net. A second for the Jets followed shortly after. This time Garner's toe-poke to Loren did find its target, and the attacker held off the defender's challenge before finishing smartly with his left foot. The Jets threatened to add a third, with Gildart and Eite going close, and Garner's free-kick being well-saved by the young YCAC keeper. The only other YCAC effort that this writer can remember is a header from a corner which went wide as John Rayner, 'Chunk' Robinson and Tomo Kobayashi kept the YCAC forwards at bay. <br>
									<br>
									 In the second half, the Jets looked to extend their lead, while YCAC fought to get back into the game. Space opened up a little, and YCAC saw more of the ball. The big midfielder, number 25, had a good game, and linked play well. The Jets were tending to over-hit the ball when playing with the wind, but still managed to create a number of chances. More free-kicks from Kobayashi and Garner were stopped by the YCAC keeper, and both Fraser Gould and Gildart narrowly failed to score when clean through. Chris Piper made the game safe with the third, scooping the rebound home after his initial shot was blocked. YCAC then fashioned a good chance, as the number 25 hit a shot from a tight angle which smacked off the outside of the post. The fourth and final Jets goal soon followed, in bizarre circumstances. A YCAC defender, under pressure from Gould, hit a firm pass back to his keeper. The ball hit a bump and looped up over the despairing goalie. It was unfortunate for the young lad in goal, who had an excellent game and deserves congratulation for keeping his team in the match at times. <br>
									 The game was played in a generally good spirit, and was well controlled by the ref. Thanks and 'Good Job' to the man in black. <br>
									<br>
									 The Saitama Jets remain the only unbeaten team in both divisions of the TML. At this stage of the season, with 3 games left to play, the team is confident that we are the best side in Division Two. We are the division's top scorers, and, unlike other promotion hopefuls, have our destiny in our own hands. <br>
