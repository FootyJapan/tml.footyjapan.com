					<p><b>Misato ASG Sun 27th November.</b> Some players are born great, some have greatness thrust upon them, and then there are guys who turn up late, hungover, in a foul temper, then get a jammy break of the ball in the box and smack home the winner.

					<p><b>Misato Sun 20th November.</b> Billed as a relegation scrap between two sides who had started the season in less than impressive fashion, Sala's preparations were thrown into disarray by the apparent disappearance of their&nbsp; centre back Clarkey.&nbsp; After it was determined that the lanky Scotsman had last been seen having an indepth conversation with the bottom of his &quot;daijoki&quot;, arrangements were made for a makeshift defense.&nbsp; The able Yusuke stepped into the centre back role and proceeded to fill the big man's shoes with distinction.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;No one knew quite what to expect from a Shogun Knights line up featuring more new faces than American Idol.&nbsp; In fact their right midfielder, sporting a pair of white sneakers with grey business socks, was booked early on for a fashion violation. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('1120salavknights.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more ...</a><br>

						Selecting the team at YCAC is never an easy job. Selecting the squad is easy, but team selection usually depends on who from the squad has turned up in time to play. This week was no different for stand in skipper&rsquo;, Phil (Alan Ball) Denham. Ten minutes to KO and only 10 to choose from and not a goalkeeper in sight.

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 20th November.</b> After hammering out a draw in this fixture last season, both teams arrived at Misato with heightened expectations. AFC brought a revamped squad brimming with confidence after their Highland Games triumph, whereas in two league fixtures Wall Street Clash had promised much in terms of performance, despite a paltry return in terms of points.<br>
						<br>
						Right from kick-off, play tended to rage around the centre of the pitch. Sustained periods of possession for either team were few and far between; a congested midfield meant little time on the ball and there were few passing sequences to entertain the two spectators and passing dog-walkers. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('1120clashvafc.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more...<br>

						The Jets started well against the 10-man strong Embassy, attacking with the verve and pace that have helped them rise to the top of Division 2.&nbsp; Gildart and Loren were looking sharp, and Sasaki, Keating and Garner were pulling the strings in midfield. The first goal came after Rob Keating's shot was blocked by the keeper, and the hungry Ryan Loren followed up the rebound. . <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('1119jetsvbefc.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more ...<br>

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 6th November.</b> The gap between the Hibs and rest of the field has narrowed in recent weeks. Although not on the table it certainly seems to have narrowed on the field. After a sparkling earl season run of form when 5 goals a game was the norm, the Hibs have scored only 2 goals in their last 200 minutes of football. In truth the YCAC probably deserved all 3 points in this bruising encounter on a bumpy YCAC pitch.<br>
						Right from kick off the Hibs were under pressure as YCAC dominated in most areas. The Hibs spoke before the kickoff about not giving away fouls around the edge of the area because of the danger presented by Damian Hart. However they soon ended up doing the opposite and gave away foul after foul in the Hibs&rsquo; own half <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('1113ycacvhibs.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more...<br>

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 6th November.</b> Sala enjoyed another awayday in Yokohama on Sunday. Their 4th visit ended with their 3rd win and, the other game drawn, they remain the only opponent that YCAC hasn't beaten in TML action.<br>
						<br>
						With a decent 14 man squad available and confidence high after dispatching a strong BFC side the week before, YCAC would ;surely make Sala wait at least 1 more week before recording their 1st win of the season. It looked that way at times, particularly during a YCAC purple patch leading up to HT but chances came and went and it was still all square at the half.. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('1106ycacvsala.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more from YCAC..</a>.<br>

					<h1 class="red">BEFC &amp; Santos Share the Spoils.</h1>
					<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 5th November.</b> BEFC avoided another Division 2 defeat by coming from behind twice at YCAC to draw with new TML outfit Santos. Santos went ahead just after the ten minute mark when their #18 smashed home a midfield through ball. BEFC leveled almost immediately when striker Steve Lidbury crossed from the left for Satoshi to nod home on the goal line.<br>
						BEFC played some fine football after the break but it was Santos who edged in front again on the hour.&nbsp;It took a Simon Woolhouse header late on to deny Santos their three points and BEFC could even have nicked a winner in the dying minutes, but were denied by some great goalkeeping and poor finishing again.<br>
						Santos are starting to find their feet at last in the division and play some fine football at times. &nbsp;BEFC are now starting to score again and will be hoping to build on this result, but remember, their next fixture is away to the in form Saitama Jets.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.<br>
