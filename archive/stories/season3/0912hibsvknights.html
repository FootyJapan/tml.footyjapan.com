								<P>Tokyo Hibernian began their 05/06 TML campaign in style with a convincing 6-1 victory over the newly promoted Shogun &ldquo;don&rsquo;t call us Nova&rdquo; Knights. The  Hibs had performed some Abromovich-esque activity in the summer transfer market, welcoming BFC and Sala&rsquo;s best players (Tomo and Naoki respectively) to their ranks and signing a couple of quality players from other leagues. The 05/06 Hibs squad looks to have the depth and quality to once again challenge for the TML crown.<br>
									<br>
									Both teams displayed their lack of taste and arrived at the party in the same green dress. At least the Hibs were on time. Cue Sid and the TML to the rescue, with some nice yellow PUMA bibs that did the job. The Hibs began well and went ahead after 5 minutes with Naoki picking up the ball outside the box, chipping it across field for Keita who played in Tomo to finish well. Another 3 minutes in and Kuni K cut it back from wide on the right, the ball reaching Tomo just outside the box on the first bounce and he scored a great goal, thumping it first time just inside the post giving the keeper no chance. 2 goals in the first 10 minutes was a nice way to make a debut.  <br>
									<br>
									The match was over as a contest before it had even begun. Tomo then laid on another goal for fellow debutante Yama. Bevan then took the ball to the bye line and cut it back for Yama who laid it off for Yasu who thumped it in from 10 yards. Keita then got into the box and skinned his man who then thought he&rsquo;d grab hold of him for the hell of it. The ref pointed to the spot and Keita turned down the chance to take the PK and Bevan put it just wide of the keeper to make it 5-0 before half time. Welcome to TML division 1 Nova &#150; Shogani(t) desho!! The Hibs were then slow to react from a rebound off the post from a corner and the midfield Knight finished well for them to get on the score sheet, 5-1 it was at half time. <br>
									<br>
									The play became more physical in the second half and Tomo paid the price for his quick feet with a late and dangerous tackle seeing him hobble off the field; unable to return. For some reason referee Verner decided to play Mr. Nice guy and keep his cards in his pocket. We hope the &ldquo;furui-pan ninja&rdquo; makes a speedy recovery in time to face the French next week. To the knights-man credit he apologized after the game and overall the match was played in a good spirit. Keita deservedly got the goal he deserved, leaving the keeper stranded with a beautiful glancing header from a well weighted diagonal ball from Josh at right back. The Knights were unlucky not to score another with Verner over ruling the linesman on a line ball off side as the striker tucked it past Hitoshi.<br>
									<br>
									As in the Premier League the newly promoted teams are the favourites to go straight back down, but The Shogun Knights showed enough fight and vigour to give many 1st division teams some problems this season.<br>
