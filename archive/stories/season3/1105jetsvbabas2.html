								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sat 5th November.</b> <br>
									TML Division 2 leaders Saitama Jets sneaked past the previously unbeaten Barbarians 2-1 thanks to a second-half winner from Nate Gildart.<br>
									<br>
									Things started badly for the high-flying Jets when a fast Barbarians break down the left within the first couple of minutes&nbsp;saw their striker find acres of space, and finish comfortably past Jets keeper&nbsp;Fraser Gould. The Saitama men hit back quickly, peppering the Babas goal throughout the first half with shots from Gildart, Eite, Keating, Sasaki, Garner and Loren. The Barbarians keeper was working hard, though, and getting down well to stop the numerous shots raining down on his goal. The men in orange looked dangerous from long balls and set-pieces, and strove to exploit the height of John Stokes and their other 'big men' wherever possible. Midway through the first-half, Garner won a free-kick for the Jets 30 yards or so from goal. Tomo Kobayashi lined up the kick, and drove it low into the bottom corner. The rest of the half belonged to the Jets, but they were unable to score again. A dead cert. penalty was bizarrely turned down by the ref, for reasons known only to him, so the teams went in at half-time at 1-1.<br>
									<br>
									Both teams came out fired up for the second half, and the Jets continued to dominate play. Rob Keating broke free on the edge of the area, and hit a shot which the Barbarians keeper couldn't hold on to. League top scorer Nate Gildart was following up, and slotted home the rebound. The Jets then pushed on for a third goal, but despite creating chances, they couldn't finish the game off. The Barbarians came back strongly towards the end of the game, and had a couple of great chances to equalize. A dipping free kick was heading towards goal until Fraser Gould tipped it over. Then, with just seconds on the clock, a deep cross from the right was met by new Barbarians forward Oleg on the volley, and his shot flew just over.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									So, a tight game between two solid sides was edged by the Jets, who now remain unbeaten after 6 league games.&nbsp;<br>
