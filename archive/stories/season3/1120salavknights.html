								<p><b>Misato Sun 20th November.</b> Billed as a relegation scrap between two sides who had started the season in less than impressive fashion, Sala's preparations were thrown into disarray by the apparent disappearance of their&nbsp; centre back Clarkey.&nbsp; After it was determined that the lanky Scotsman had last been seen having an indepth conversation with the bottom of his &quot;daijoki&quot;, arrangements were made for a makeshift defense.&nbsp; The able Yusuke stepped into the centre back role and proceeded to fill the big man's shoes with distinction.</p>

								<p>&nbsp;No one knew quite what to expect from a Shogun Knights line up featuring more new faces than American Idol.&nbsp; In fact their right midfielder, sporting a pair of white sneakers with grey business socks, was booked early on for a fashion violation.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Sala began the match well, gaining the ascendancy in midfield through the hard work of Brookey and Lenny on the wings and Toby in the middle.&nbsp; Toby shot over the bar after some clever work by Brookey and Bedingfield but big Stu Anderson, playing in an unfamiliar sweeping role for the Knights, was doing a good job of thwarting Sala's attacks.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Midway through the half Brookey was forced to leave the field in great discomfort after his glancing &quot;header&quot; failed to find the target.&nbsp; He spent the rest of the half on the bench, bemoaning the pinpoint accuracy of Toby's free kick.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Sala's possesion eventually told as big Doug Lee's speculative cross from the right somehow eluded the Knights keeper, ricocheting off Bedingfield's nipple and into the back of the net to cap a tittilating first half from the Aussie.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Steve Hubert made it 2-0 soon after, capitalizing on a Lenny Tui mystery cross that somehow weaved it's way through a crowd of Knights defenders to find a confused Canadian waiting on the goal line.&nbsp; Just reward for a player who has been in stellar form of late.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									After the break the match degenerated into the kind of scrappy affair befitting two clubs wallowing in the murky depths of the relegation zone.&nbsp; Neither side could hold the ball for long but Sala substitute Shigehisa had a chance to score his first goal for the club, his shot being easily saved by the keeper.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;</p>

								<p>Some good bullocking work by Brian Gallagher allowed Toby to wriggle free and direct a bobbling shot through the hands of the keeper for Sala's third.&nbsp; However, Sala captain Guido was unhappy with the way his side were playing and decided to go for a numerical advantage subbing Shigehisa for the duo of Giles and Bedingfield.&nbsp; The ploy failed to work and the only further substitution was that of the referee's brain in the 70th minute.&nbsp; Toby was awarded a hypothetical free kick on the edge of the box for a supposed foul that actually occured closer to the penalty spot.&nbsp; And minutes later the unfortunate Knights right back was booked for being at the scene of the crime under FIFA's new law &quot;conspiracy to commit a foul&quot;.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									But the only thing that resulted for Sala was a string of missed chances.&nbsp; Steve Hubert's declared himself a &quot;s**thead&quot; after two chances went begging.&nbsp; Will he ever have a better chance to score a hatrick in the TML?&nbsp; Towards the end of the match it was the Knights who looked more like scoring on the break and&nbsp;big Sid had to perform admirably to keep his third clean sheet in succesion.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Sala left Misato happy with the three points but improvement will be necessary as they face the in form Jets and the Hibs early next month.&nbsp; The Knights will look to next weeks match against France as an opportunity to pick up their first points of the season.<br>
