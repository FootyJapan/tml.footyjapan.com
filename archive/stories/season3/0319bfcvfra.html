								<p><b>Todoroki, Sun 19th March.</b> Move over Roman Abramovich and Jose Mourinho. BFC's most expensively assembled squad ever (approx JPY8,000 including taxis to and from the ground and the charge of JPY300 per person to use the showers after the game)&nbsp;took the field on a cold and windy&nbsp;Sunday evening against France FC at Todoroki Soccer Ground. With 7 first team squad players already missing through injury and other commitments, three additional call offs on the day&nbsp;was not the perfect preparation for this match.&nbsp;With no&nbsp;expense spared, replacement players were found following a&nbsp;flurry of emails, phone calls, smoke signals, emergency SOS messages from Brian, Jon and Phil, in a move that is widely predicted to ensure a dramatic improvement in&nbsp;NTT Docomo's 2nd quarter results.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									In contrast, BFC's overall&nbsp;results this season have been something of a disappointment, so this 3-1 victory over France FC will be of some relief to the club that finds itself languishing in mid-table rather than challenging for the league. Following this result, some TML Analysts were even moved to alter the&nbsp;BFC stock rating of 'overweight' to a new rating of 'still overweight, but sector perform'.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Using the league supplied map (and I quote, &quot;10 minutes by taxi.&quot; Doesn't say to where though does it!!), BFC were dropped at various points near nowhere in particular by several conspiring taxi drivers with only a real stadium, a baseball pitch and a not so helpful groundswoman at the local park for points of reference.&nbsp;Still, on reflection, if you are going to have&nbsp;2/3 of the team wandering around without much of a clue where they&nbsp;are and what they are doing, it is best to ensure it is the 20 minutes<br>
									before the start of the game I suppose.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									In a promising omen, BFC actually won the toss though taking advantage of the excessively strong wind&nbsp;wasn't that easy given it blowing in just about every direction possible.&nbsp; Still, BFC had the better of the early exchanges with Tomo in his second&nbsp;game over 2 years proving to be a very influential player on the right side of midfield. While others struggled with their touch and passing, he caused many problems for the French, linking well in particular with Tom K, Jon D and Momo.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									BFC had a series of corners with Jon B rising magnificently only to see his header crash against the post. Almost immediately, France had a counter attack with their forward finding the BFC&nbsp;bar following a&nbsp;comedy of&nbsp;errors allowing the French to work their way through midfield. Yet another BFC attack and corner saw Jon B and Tomo each dummy, fake and jink before Tomo got bored and smashed in BFC's first from the right hand side of the French penalty area. 1-0 up and nerves settled a little.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Instead of sitting and controlling things, BFC unwisely allowed France to almost immediately&nbsp;pour forward. After several failed&nbsp;clearances, a lofted ball that seemed to swirl forever in the wind, confused&nbsp;- of all people - Dr. Lowes, physics boffin in the BFC area, and up popped TML Div 1 leading scorer E.Yoshikoshi (cracking name that) to level things from close range. 1-1.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									There followed&nbsp;a&nbsp;period of football of sorts played in eerie silence by both teams,&nbsp;with the only noise to be heard coming from&nbsp;either the wind, or&nbsp;Ricky the Ref each taking it in turns to see who could whistle the loudest. In virtual silence, BFC worked the ball down the right and the played inside to&nbsp;Brian D who unleashed a shot that was destined for, well, God knows where, but it found a temporary home on the outstretched arm of French player in the box. Penalty to BFC, dispatched with aplomb to the bottom left corner by Dr. Lowes, whose book on 'The Seven Places for Highly Successful Penalty Takers' is due to be released shortly. 2-1 BFC.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The noise and pace&nbsp;of the game picked up after that with both teams giving out some pretty strong challenges and one or two on each side spending more time arguing and complaining rather than getting on with the game, with Momo BFC's chief culprit managing to getting himself booked.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The second half saw Tony R come on at the back with Wayne B who had toiled hard&nbsp;in difficult conditions up front take a break. France rallied and BFC tried to play as much as conditions allowed, but it certainly was not pretty. James, Phil and Steve at the back were up to anything the French could throw at them. Jyrki saved smartly low down at his near post and the ever polite Tony had an absolute stormer at right back, evening offering a 'sorry guy' for a characteristically solid and well intended tackle which left a French player face down in the dirt.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Chances came and went for BFC with Momo unable to finish a&nbsp;header from close in; Tomo and Jon Day each letting a couple get away. Still, Tom who had distinguished himself in just about every position on the pitch saved a ball from going out of play, sending it down the line for Jon D (or B?) to pick up. While the French protested the cross came in and Tomo was able to claim his second goal and immediately put himself well up on the top 5 list&nbsp;of BFC top scorers this season. 3-1 the final score as BFC took the points, and look to get themselves further up the table in time for a semi respectable end to the season.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Despite the result, getting home was not fun. It was cold, dark and miserable. The streets were empty and you get the distinct impression that nobody is allowed out on foot in&nbsp;Musashi Kosugi past nightfall.&nbsp;Tumbleweed swirled&nbsp;across the barren land as several cowboys in taxis&nbsp;drove past&nbsp;ignoring the pleas to be taken back to civilization, cackling to themselves in delight. Imagine what it would have felt like if we lost.<br>
