								<p><b>St Mary's Sat 8th October.</b> After last season's exciting fixture when the Hibs came from 2-0 behind at half time to win 3-2 there was no doubt that both teams desperately wanted to win this game. Due to suspension, travel, hangovers, injury and other reasons the Hibs fielded their weakest squad of the season with 14 players available to make the long journey out to Hon -Atsugi. <br>
									<br>
									The match began on even terms but 5 minutes in and a long clearance from the France FC keeper was met first time by Hibs-man Taras, but his first touch pass ricocheted into a French player and fell to France FC&rsquo;s midfielder Julien Sepherapdes&rsquo; path at the half way mark. Julien ran into space and both Hibs defenders backed away from him, Hitoshi moved up off his line looking for the through ball, so Julien decided to shoot and thumped one into the breeze over Hitoshi and into the net. 1-0 down and this was the first time the Hibs had been behind this season and Les Blues were justifiably jubilant (with Julien)&#x2026;..  It was a test of the Hibs&rsquo; mettle as to how they would respond to the challenge. <br>
									<br>
									In the last 20 minutes of the first half the Hibs began to dominate possession and territory. Yohei Ohta was causing problems down the left flank and Yama was using the ball intelligently up front.  The breakthrough came shortly before half time when the ball fell to Mick on the back post and he thumped a shot in with plenty of power, but off target, headed for the corner flag. Keita&rsquo;s quick thinking and quick feet diverted the ball on target and past the France keeper. 1-1 into the break. Game on. <br>
									<br>
									The Hibs continued to dominate in the second half and had a number of chances in the first 20 minutes, but the ball did not want to go in the net. Then Naoki won another ball in the middle and squared it to Taras who thumped a long diagonal pass that found Tomo in the box, he laid it back on the bounce to Josh who controlled it with his chest on the run and shot from 25 yards, hitting it like a bullet into the far corner. A great goal, at a great time for the Hibs.  <br>
									<br>
									After several contentious off side calls, that caused a bit of banter between opposing players on the touchline, Yama got the goal he deserved. Hitoshi&rsquo;s long clearance was under hit by the French captain as he tried to back head it back to the keeper and Yama nicked in to chip the keeper to put it beyond doubt. 4 wins from 4 for the Hibs is a promising start, but there is a long way to go in this 2005/6 TML season.<br>
