								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 14th January.</b> On an interesting day for league footy, the Swiss went down 3-1 to a Jetro side which this manager had never seen before.&nbsp; I think it had 3 players from the team we played earlier in the year and a stronger group was assembled than the team they replaced.&nbsp; In addition to the surprise of a totally new team, both teams had to deal with more puddles than players and a freezing rain on a chilly night in Saitama. &nbsp;<br>
									Traditional apathy by the Swiss team led to 3 cancellations prior to game time and a little bit of arrogance led to a few surprising tackles as the new Jetro (or whoever they were) was up for the game in the puddle. &nbsp;Incredibly, the Swiss started off the scoring with Karl picking the ball out of a puddle as a defender ran past the stuck ball and crossed nicely to Koi who headed home.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Jetro came right back with their left midfielder essentially walking unmarked to the edge of the area and smashing the equalizer home into the right side of the net. &nbsp;From there, it was basically a question of who could get it into the area and which team would make fewer mistakes.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the Swiss, they were at fault and 2 chances were taken by the Jetro #21 to put them in a commading position. &nbsp;The Swiss pushed forward in search of anything but everyone was guilty of missing chances and then the whistle blew. &nbsp;Poor conditions, poor pitch, poor attitude, poor result. &nbsp;Pretty much sums up the way things are going this year.<br>
