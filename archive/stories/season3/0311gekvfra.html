								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 11th March</b>. Eight goals were shared by two teams made up of predominantly English and French players, as The Geckoes ran out 5-3 winners over fourth placed France F.C, at Hachioji park on Saturday afternoon.<br>
									<br>
									The first goal was scored by the French number 14; Etsushi Yoshikoshi, who received a skillfully chipped ball from number 6 on the right side of midfield. New Geckoe defender Nat' was left isolated as he lost the chase to the ball and the lanky striker duely opened the scoring, taking his tally to 14 for the season.<br>
									<br>
									The Geckoes weren't behind for long though, as veteran defender-cum-midfielder Gay Stout struck his first goal for the club. Some neat passing on the right from Mikkel Troen and Kazu Kikuichi resulted in the ball falling to Stout just inside the penalty area. Having witnessed Gino Dilberto scoring a disallowed goal a few days earlier against the Kickers, Stout figured it was his turn to get on the score sheet as he fired in an unstoppable shot to bring the Geckoes level. A goal so sweetly struck couldn't come at a better time, especially as Gary's father, George, ( visiting from Scotland), was watching from the sidelines.<br>
									<br>
									The game immediately swung back to the opposite half though, as the French numbers 6 and 7 switched wings, causing more bewilderment within the Geckoe defence. To help combat the threat, especially from the creative number 6, Tony Moore was brought on to help shore up the Geckoe backline.<br>
									<br>
									This seemed to spur on the team in blue as the Geckoes' Japanese striker Kikuichi skipped past a challenge or two, before firing confidently into the back of the net. Having been carrying an injury for over a month; Kikuichi was delighted to get back on the score sheet, and to make it 2-1  going into an overally long interval.<br>
									<br>
									It was a lead the Geckoes were determined not to lose as they entered the second period. However, they were dealt a blow when right back Robert Englund had to go off with a hamstring injury, causing the defence to lose shape and the French to have large gaps to attack as they looked to get even.<br>
									<br>
									This wasn't to happen, however, as the skipper Simon Bromwell floated in a typically accurate corner for the Geckoe sweeper, Peter Exton to volley home and make it 3-1 to Geckoes. Hachioji seems to be a lucky venue for the former midfielder, as he scored his third goal of the season at this venue taking his tally to four overall.<br>
									<br>
									Indeed Bromwell, captaining the side in the continued absence of Simon Jelfs, could have made it 4-1 soon after, as he blasted over with his weaker left foot after being fed by the creative force of Mikkel Troen.<br>
									<br>
									Instead, the French seized the opportunity and rushed down the other end of the park to win a penalty after a clumsy challenge by Exton. Charles was unlucky not to save Yoshikoshi's strike, as he guessed correctly by diving to the right. Nevertheless, the French were right back in it, at 3-2.<br>
									<br>
									Troen finally got on the score sheet for himself though, as he scored his 6th goal of the campaign to put Geckoes 4-2 up. Amazingly, however, the French did not give up and on a rare venture upfield, the bearded number three swooped to steal another goal for his team after some slack marking by the Geckoe number 8.<br>
									<br>
									The pace of the game never let up and at one stage it looked as though the Geckoe defence may cave in, but they stood firm as Exton, Pemberton, Zollar and Moore all produced solid, committed play to stem the French assaults.<br>
									<br>
									This allowed the skillful Jonathon and Troen to carve an opening for Rob Keyworth to tap in from close range (as he had done at YCAC a month earlier) and make the game safe for the Geckoes. They weren't allowed to relax, however, as Spencer Reynolds reminded his team mates as the seconds ticked away. But they held firm to hold on for their first three points of 2006, only to remain third bottom with a game in hand.<br>
									<br>
									Indeed, the team should be higher in the table when you consider their record against the top four teams: that they have drawn to Hibs, beaten the French and lost by only a solitary goal to both the Kickers and YCAC all within the space of two months. But with plenty of games still to go, the Geckoes theaten to march on into the Spring and gain a position in the league standings of which they are worthy.<br>
