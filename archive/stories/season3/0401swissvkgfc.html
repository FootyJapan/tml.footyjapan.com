									Oh, do I hope the designers of YCAC&rsquo;s new ground see the light (or anything resembling the real dimensions of a footy pitch) and decide to make it regulation size.&nbsp; Will the TML be forced to play on a kiddie ground all next year where the imposing presence of Sala&rsquo;s big boys, Bruising Bevan from the Hibs, and Damian the YCAC crusher, just to name a few, eliminate all skill from the pitch because they only have to run 5 yards to smack the next player?&nbsp; The YCAC and St. Mary&rsquo;s pitches are a disaster because if you are lucky enough to connect a pass, three players are all over you and you are forced to make a bad decision for fear of being knocked into Yokohama&rsquo;s Chinatown by one of the TML&rsquo;s nicer bunch.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									On a larger ground, you create the space through effort and vision, with skillful players around you, the ball gets delivered and you can play constructive football which is great to play (if you know how) and exciting to watch.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried to make my case for a larger ground, if there are any YCAC members reading this, please communicate this to the board which is continuing to discuss the construction of the new Astroturf pitch at the Club.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Anyway, regarding the KGFC vs. Swiss game, there were 10 goals scored and some brilliant football played until it got sloppy in the second half.&nbsp; Aoki was crossing in some sweet balls from the right hand side and 8 different people scored for the Swiss.&nbsp; It was 4-0 at half time and went to 6-0 before JP held back one of the KGFC players in the box for a PK and then gifted a goal by clearing the ball onto his own hand, the KGFC player took it off him and knocked it in past Peter in goal. &nbsp;The Swiss are starting to peak (a little late to catch the Hibs. I&rsquo;m afraid) but hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to finish the season undefeated.&nbsp; 2 tough games vs. the YCAC over the next 2 weeks will be key.<br>
