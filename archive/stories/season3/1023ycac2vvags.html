								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunday 23rd October.</b> A beautiful day at YCAC, with Fuji-san looking splendid in the Autumn sunshine and temperature a balmy 20 degrees.&nbsp; There can't be a better place to play football when the weather is like that.&nbsp; YCAC were a little shorter of players than the email response had suggested, but still a good 13 or so.&nbsp; Nice to see Paul Wood and Tim Williams back. And always a pleasure to play in front of Peter Pauli in goal!<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Vagabonds started the stronger of the two teams and probably did enough in the first half to score, although in truth clear-cut chances were few and far between.&nbsp; Their forward line was lead well by James, whose ability in the air and general pace were a handful.&nbsp; He was ably backed up by the ever-green Adrian, Pabs and Ian Warner.&nbsp; The YCAC defence was undoubtedly the busiest of the 2 teams, with Paul Wood and Tom Richards particularly effective.&nbsp; Both teams struggled to put a good passing game together for any length of time, I thought Jonathan and Genki worked hard up front with any ball they did get.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Second half we felt was more even with chances at both ends.&nbsp; The insertion of Viv in the YCAC midfield certainly added some drive.&nbsp; We also looked better on the right when we switched Tim Williams to midfield and Nick Cooper to right back.&nbsp; YCAC should have scored when Tim was inches away from a great cross by Genki, while at the other end Peter P. did a great job in saving a penalty.&nbsp; The penalty itself was a bit harsh.&nbsp; YCAC 2nds probably had the next-best chance to steal the points towards the close, only to see the shot beaten out by the Vags keeper Taylor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game ended goal-less.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Quite competitive game with a few yellow cards dished out.&nbsp; Referee had a great game, kept control well at all times and ignored a lot of whingeing.&nbsp; And thank you to Joe for running the line - what a good Club man he is!<br>
