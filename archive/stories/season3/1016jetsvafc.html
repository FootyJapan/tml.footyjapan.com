								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 16th October.</b> Saitama Jets keeper Fraser Gould went from villain to hero as the Jets laboured to a 3-1 victory over the AFC Wanderers.<br>
									<br>
									The Jets had spanked the Wanderers 5-0 and 6-1 in the last two games between the teams, so were hoping for an easy win, but some gritty play from AFC and some profligate finishing by the Jets forwards made this a tight match. Gould gave the Wanderers an early present, and his team a handicap, swinging his boot wildly at a weak shot, missing, and watching the ball trickle painfully and slowly into his goal. The Jets went on the attack, peppering Jackie's AFC goal with shots, but solid defending and some good goalkeeping kept the score at 1-0. The Jets eventually levelled when Rob Keating's through ball was pounced on by Ryan Loren, who beat the keeper at the second attempt. Shortly after, Loren turned provider, as his cross was met with a neat volley by strike partner Nate Gildart. 2-1 at half-time, with the Jets looking to add to their tally in the second half.<br>
									<br>
									Sasaki, Garner, Kobayashi and Keating all worked openings in the second half, and fine movement from Loren and Gildart put them in good positions in front of goal. Unfortunately, on at least 6 or 7 occasions, the finishing didn't match the build up play, and Jackie 'The Cat' in the Wanderers goal stopped everything that was hit at him. The Wanderers started to gain a little confidence, and at 2-1, a scramble in the Jets box saw keeper Gould react brilliantly, saving a goal-bound effort with his feet. The Jets promptly went up the other end, and Nate Gildart calmly slotted home his second, and the Jets third, to ease the Jets nerves and wrap up the 3 points.<br>
									<br>
									So, Saitama remain unbeaten after 4 games, but will have to perform better than this if they want to remain near the top of the league.<br>
