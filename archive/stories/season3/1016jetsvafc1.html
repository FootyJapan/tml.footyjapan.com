								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 16th October. </b>A sodden Hachioji park pitch saw the perennial underdogs AFC take on the in form and improving Saitama Jets. The two teams certainly know a bit about each other, hostilities, banter and the odd handshake were guaranteed.<br>
									<br>
									AFC started with only 10, Jets with a full compliment and 7 on the bench. AFC started with two banks of four. The machine Trent out on the right. Olly dropping back into Mid with Le Condom detective Eric playing anchor. Chris on the left ably supported by Lee at left back. The rock solid German center half partnership of Andreas and Tobias limbered up at the heart of the defence with Ben slotting into right back. The monster Shinki was left up front to chase and get near anything he could. Needless to say Chappers Chan was the custodian of AFC dignity.  <br>
									<br>
									Starting with ten, AFC once again knew they were up against it and with many players in new positions struggled to find any shape. The first 15 mins saw AFC soaking up the pressure from the Jets, Tobias in the thick of the action making some solid and timely challenges in and around the 18yrd box. Andreas scything down anyone who came near him and also playing a few tasty through balls to Eric. Calmness and just a bit of composure was called for by Olly and he urged the lads to start playing their way up the field. As Chris eased into his role, he stemmed most of the attacks the Jets launched down the left. <br>
									<br>
									AFC soaked up whatever Jets threw at them, and they were putting together some very impressive approach play &#150; it was just that AFC had the luck of the bounce and the pitch conditions didn't exactly help getting the ball under control, to be honest it favoured a welly out of defence rather than a bit of skill and a well placed pass. This gave AFC a bit confidence and the lads started to win the ball back in the middle with Trent and Eric running their socks off. Jackie was also pulling off some inspiring saves in sticks which seemed to give a lift to whole team, especially with only ten on the park&#x2026;..<br>
									<br>
									Cue Lincoln&#x2026;.<br>
									<br>
									20 mins late, but let's just say he timed his run perfectly and after coming on to even up the numbers, his first touch slid the ball past the Jets keeper after a chase from a probing ball from Trent on the right<br>
									<br>
									Saitama 0 AFC 1<br>
									<br>
									Jets didn't take it too well understandably and AFC tried to dig in until the break Eventually the stats would even out - Jets worked the ball around superbly from the right &#150; a couple of deft touches in the box and the ball soon trickled over the line. Fair play, Jets deserved the notch and the second was soon to come as the difference between the teams began to show. <br>
									<br>
									At 2-1 AFC started to commit players upfield and take a chance knowing Jackie was picking them out of the air in sticks. Tobias was getting in on the act around the box and tracking back well. Ben was eager to give some options overlapping and Eric and Chris worked superbly to get the ball straight back off the Jets. After a sustained period of play in the Jets half AFC just couldn't find the equalizer, Olly trying to feed Lincoln and Shinki and on another day it would&rsquo;ve worked wonders, but it was much the same for both teams. Lincoln went agonizingly close with a one on one. At same time Jets were taking advantage of the breakaways- hitting the woodwork twice and failing to beat Jackie as he stood up tall to foil another one on one, putting the shot out for a corner. Inevitably the momentum subsided and the whistle was nigh. At the death Jets scored the goal that made it safe, but they will be a bit aggrieved they didn&rsquo;t close out the game. But lets give immense credit to the AFC lads who played the game with 200% commitment and some effective football. All 11 did their bit, although MOM must go to the custodian who gave the outfield guys a fighting chance- Well played Jackie.<br>
