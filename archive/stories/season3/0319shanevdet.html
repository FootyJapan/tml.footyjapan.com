								<p><b>Mitsuike Koen, Sun 19th March.</b> Shane FC belied their reputation as the meanest defence in Division Two by conceding three in their encounter with the Dutch Embassy. That was one more than they had hitherto let in all season. Just to show that this was a day in which past precedent would be no guide, Shane, usually shy in front of goal, helped themselves to six goals to keep their faint hopes of a promotion place alive. Yet for all the thrills and spills in front of goal this was no classic.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Instead the game will go down in memory as the last appearance of Alex Padmore, soon to depart these shores to commence married life in the glamorous surrounds of Stoke. His parting shots were a couple of well taken second half goals that guaranteed the points going to Shane. His presence will be missed and all at Shane wish him and the missus well. Maybe it&rsquo;s a marriage thing but skipper for the day Peter McGill helped himself to a brace in his final game before getting hitched. Good look for the big day to you too, Pete.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									These goals, along with a penalty from Paul James and a comedy strike from Tom Beakes direct from a corner, ensured the game always remained out of reach for the Embassy who, despite their defensive frailties, posed problems up front for Shane&rsquo;s usually tight defence. The Embassy&rsquo;s number 13 in particular proved a particular thorn throughout the afternoon.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									All at Shane FC would like to take the opportunity to offer their best wishes for a speedy recovery to those Celts players injured in our recent encounter.<br>
