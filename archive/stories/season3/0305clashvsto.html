								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 5th March.</b> An advertisement on the TML website reads 'Refs wanted; Can you control 22 noisey (sic) sweaty duffers on a weekend?'. 22 is a number harsh on some teams with Stoneds FC being one of them but the Clash certainly try to provide their quota. Unfortunately the noise that most of them provide is not used to help communicate effectively and today was a prime example of that. The referee at YCAC today had to talk to a few of the Clash players about their colourful language in the presence of children. The quieter side lacked duffers and hardly broke into a sweat as they came out 3-1 winners.<br>
									<br>
									The first half provided no goals and little if any excitement unless you count an accidental but nasty knee in the knackers which I don't. The Clash tried to be physical and mostly limited Stoneds FC to very hopeful and wild long range efforts. Michael was unlucky to see the keeper get back to catch an attempted lob, Sid hit the post with a trickling effort and Andy Drought hit a fairly powerful shot from  range but straight at the keeper. Yet again a number 11 was proving too good for the Clash and the Stoneds FC 11 was showing nice touches, a range of passing, good close control and some unnecessary arrogance. He was also hitting shots very wildly when passes might have been better. At halftime honours fairly even but if anything the Clash shading things having played a little bit of nice football in patches without really looking as though they might gain control of the game.<br>
									<br>
									The second half started at pace and despite the Clash having two substitutes at their disposal and Stoneds FC none the Japanese side were looking the fitter and hungrier of the two sides. Clash were struggling to take goal kicks, free kicks and corners. Where they could have made use of their height in players like Ian, Ping, Yu and Sid the delivery was just not up to scratch with nobody confident or able enough to take a good dead ball. This definitely calls for some practice before next week's match! Maybe dead eye Alec needs to get back on the corners once he has some boots rather than his big comfy white trainers.<br>
									<br>
									Lack of communication and slowness to prepare in a dead ball situation eventually cost the Clash. This time it was Stoneds FC's free kick and the cocky number 11 hit a shot into a gaping net as the up until then unbeatable Elliot was standing against his post organising his wall. 1-0 and not long after 2-0 as the Stoneds FC players realised they had the beating of the Clash midfield and defenders and started to pass and dribble into the area rather than take long range shots. Ken was badly missed again this day in an unfit and poorly organised midfield with too much space between the central midfielders with one just returning from a few weeks out and one obviously suffering the notorious Sunday League Flu. Yes Mr Drought was yet again top of the hangover charts. He did manage another drunken goal though with a nice header from a Yasu cross.<br>
									<br>As the Clash pushed forward playing the popular 1890s formation of 3-1-6 more mysterious gaps were magically appearing and Stoneds FC were just being kept out by some good goalkeeping from Elliot and stout defending by Yu, Ian and Ping. At the other end Daylan missed a sitter when he seemed unsure to shoot with his left or right and the ball just bounced away from him. He almost made up for it though with a nicely timed run ending with a powerful header just over the bar from another fine Yasu cross. Stoneds FC still had time for one more breakaway goal and the poor use of the dead ball from the Clash meant that they could not get back into the game with the corners and free kicks they had in the dying moments of the game. What had been an evenly contested game until half time ended an easy win for Stoneds FC.<br>
									<br>
									Lessons to be learnt from today for the Clash? Quick or at least accurate (Sid!), practised goal kicks, free kicks and corners. Better communication with less swearing (myself included there and my apologies to the referee) and more shouts for man on and for the return ball. More listening too please! If a player puts his name on it let that player take it and if it is between two of our own players make sure one of you confidently claims it rather than waiting for the opposition to stroll in and nick it. Maybe if Daylan scores next week he will stay around for a celebratory pint with the lads. It would be nice to see some more of our lads stay around for a drink and a talk about the game in future. Family responsibilities being the only excuse. You now who you are lads so come on!<br>
