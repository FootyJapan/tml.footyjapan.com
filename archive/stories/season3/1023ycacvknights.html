								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunday 23rd October.</b> YCAC1 eased past a plucky Knights side in the Autumn sunshine at YCAC on Sunday Lunchtime. 3-0 down at HT, the Knights might have been forgiven for rolling over but to their credit they stepped up their running and tackiling and harried YCAC right up to the final whistle. A Genki Rasmussen header was the only addition to the scoring as the home team ran out 4-0 winners<br>
									<br>
									The feature of the 1st half was 2 outstanding goals from YCAC. A Damian Hart Special from 25 yards and a close range header from James Absolom from a superb Joe Takeda cross who in turn had been set free by a pinpoint ball from Gary Hodgson. James managed to get his 2nd goal of the half from even closer in, heading home as the GK juggled with the ball on his own line.<br>
									<br>
									Phil Denham who, following complaints from local residents, is normally discouraged from shooting, forced a full length diving stop from the Knights Keeper with a long range free kick in the 2H and YCAC had a number of other chances to add to their tally during the period. The Knights performance deserved better than for them to end up being beaten by a cricket score, however, and YCAC were more than happy with&nbsp;the clean sheet and 3 points.<br>
									<br>
									Niether team were shy in the tackle but a fair game well reffed by Quentin whose cards weren't required all afternoon.<br>
