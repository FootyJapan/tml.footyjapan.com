								<p><b>Big Circus Sat 5th November.</b> As both clubs had strengthened their squad in the off season and been winning games and not conceding goals this fixture looked like a tasty one. The Hibs soon started to press and it was that man Keita who charged down a clearance (with his face) and found himself one on one with the keeper in no man&rsquo;s land 18 yards out. Most of us that know Keita had started to turn to go back for the ensuing kick off, but Keita was still stunned from the clearance and scuffed his shot and the big BFC keeper got his arm in the way. Next it was Tomo&rsquo;s turn as he was released into a gap only to see the BFC keeper Jurky stay big and parry into Jorgen&rsquo;s path who thumped a shot from 4 yards but a defender got in the way and cleared it off the line. It seemed like the Hibs were out of luck until a long diagonal ball that found a BFC defender who scuffed his clearance into George&rsquo;s path. George &ldquo;Pele&rdquo; Clarkson had only been on the pitch 2 minutes and he shaped to shoot, then dummied and pulled it square around the last defender and thumped a cracking shot from 15 yards that the keeper did well to parry, but another failed clearance fell back into Pele&rsquo;s path,  and he decided to side foot it from waist high and nudged it past the keeper and into the net. The Hibs members were stoked that it was the popular Clarkson who got the goal. George almost added another 2 minutes later when he charged down a keeper&rsquo;s clearance with his head but it just went wide.<br>
									<br>
									into half time but the Hibs were left feeling disappointed that they weren&rsquo;t 2 or 3 up. Early in the second half and Hibs man Kuni K beat Ryo the last man in defense, who then decided it best to wrestle him to the ground, and after 10 metres of trying finally succeeded just outside the area,. The ref decided to pull the free kick back 10 metres and let Rio off without any other penalty or warning. This infuriated a few of the more emotional members of the Hibs and some grumpy Aussie let the ref know what he thought about it, seeing yellow 5 minutes later for moaning about some meaningless incident. Some people never learn. As BFC continued to sit deep the Hibs continued to spur chances, Yohei and Keita both guilty on separate occasions, but Jurky the keeper was proving a considerable obstacle to pass. The last 20 minutes saw the tide turn with BFC finally pressing their defenders and midfield further upfield and &ldquo;Pink&rdquo; Neil coming into his own with some tricky dribbling and Jon Day and Paul Wadsworth beginning to show their class and create things.  The Hibs defenders proved just equal to the task and the match finished at 1-0.<br>
									Although the Hibs have maximum points from their 7 games they are only too aware that the 2005/6 TML season is a long, long way from over.<br>
