								<p><b>Big Circus, Sun 11th December.</b> British Embassy finally got their act together having not won a fixture since their opening 1-0 win over Wall Street Clash FC in September.&nbsp; In fact, both BEFC and Vagabonds misfortunes have run parallel this season with both sides on only 5 points a piece and struggling in a competitive 2nd Division.&nbsp; So, this game was either going to be a drab draw or a complete goal fest.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Luckily it was the latter, with 5 delightful goals to choose from.&nbsp; Vagabonds started the more confident and determined, playing some very nice football indeed, especially through the centre of the park, with Ian Warner and Dave Ainsley creating some nice chances. The boys in red were to be fair on the back foot for the better part of the opening 15 minutes or so. The blues should have taken the lead, as another Vagabonds charge had the Embassy defence in a panic.&nbsp; A Vagabond shot sneaked through a cluster of players and seemed destined for the bottom left corner of the goal, but a dramatic goal line clearance by Mike Yeomans kept the sides goalless.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Then with 20 minutes gone BEFC striker and former J-League junior Hitoshi burst into life and showed everybody what he was capable of.&nbsp; The BEFC magician was only on as a late replacement for the missing Steve Lidbury, who was presumably recovering from &ldquo;Post Traumatic Pub Disorder&rdquo;. &nbsp;Some nice interplay in midfield between Masao and Tetsuro found the waiting Hitoshi, who then skillfully volleyed a through ball crossing his right leg over his left and into the path of Ryan France, who gleefully smashed home his first goal for the club past a hapless Taylor Mignon. This pertinent flash of brilliance from Hitoshi had to be seen to be believed.&nbsp; Half time 1-0.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The second half saw a similar pattern emerging as with the opening 15 minutes or so of the first, with Vagabonds putting in attack after attack. &nbsp;Everything good for the blues came from the creative play of Ainsley &amp; Warner (sounds like an estate agents).&nbsp; Finally after several corners and constant pressure, the Vagabonds were deservedly level with (goal scorer) running at the Embassy defenders and smashing home a shot from 18 yards, past new BEFC substitute keeper Osamu.&nbsp; But that was it for the Vagabonds, as their challenge gradually withered.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>British Embassy then upped a couple of gears and had one of those ten minute spells that most teams dream of.&nbsp; Some of the midfield play between Masao, Hitoshi and Tetsuro was of real quality and the pace of their play was blistering. &nbsp;Embassy were back in front within 5 minutes, with Masao unleashing a sublime goal bound shot, only to see it come off the underside of the crossbar, however, Tetsuro was on hand to finish off the rebound. 2-1<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									A few minutes later the score flicked up to 3-1 as Masao stroked home a wonderful cross from Hitoshi on the right, who continued to terrorize the Vagabonds defence at will.&nbsp; Newly appointed BEFC captain Tim Letheren then got in on the act, adding a fourth after some more superb work from Masao who unlocked the blues back line once more. &nbsp;The score could have been 5-1, but BEFC midfielder Will Ryan had a &ldquo;Prefab Crouch&rdquo; moment and scuffed his shot wide from 8 yards out.&nbsp; Mr. Lidbury would not have been impressed.&nbsp; Mike Yeomans also came close with a free kick late on, but his effort crept just over the bar. &nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Under the stewardship of Captain Tim Letheren the Embassy fully deserved their victory over a resilient Vagabonds side.&nbsp; There were some other notable performances on the day from both teams, but with Hitoshi, Masao &amp; Co. running the show, everybody else seemed to pale by comparison.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be a very merry Christmas down at the Embassy.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									<b>Man of the Match: Hitoshi &#150; All flicks, tricks and lashings of pace. 10/10&nbsp;<br>
