								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 19th February.</b> In many ways it has been a frustrating season in the TML for YCAC 2nd - rarely turned over, but we have drawn with teams we could have beaten and lost by the odd goal when a draw might have been a fairer result.&nbsp; So a nice change for us to record a solid win.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									All the goals came in the first half, with YCAC getting the first 3 before being pegged 1 back on the stroke of half-time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed&nbsp;opened the scoring with a long range effort,&nbsp;the Santos keeper being the latest in a long line of goal keepers on this pitch to be deceived by a vicious&nbsp;bounce.&nbsp; The back 4 of YCAC were then under constant pressure as Santos  looked to free up their fast strikers, but a series of bobbles and good keeping&nbsp;frustrated them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									Jonathan in goal pulled off a great save down to his left, the ball broke from Neil to Tim M. on the half-way line who then dribbled past 2 or 3 defenders and&nbsp;unleashed&nbsp;an unstoppable shot from just inside the box.&nbsp; Great goal, maybe the best we've scored this season&nbsp;and all came form that save.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									Our 3rd goal was more of a scramble from a corner which was poked just over the line.&nbsp; Unfortunately at the stroke of half-time, we conceded a messy goal from a mishit freekick.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Second half ended up goalless, but not incident free as both sides hit the post and with Jonathan again making a great stop from a goal-bound shot.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									A handy&nbsp;win against good opponents, who on another day could&nbsp;have notched 2 or 3 goals.&nbsp; I think for YCAC&nbsp;the difference came in midfield, where the 5 tracked back tirelessly and protected the defence very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final word for referee, who had his usual calm and very effective game.<br>
