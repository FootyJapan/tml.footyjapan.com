								<p><b>Big Circus, Sunday 28th May.</b> The Swiss were missing 10 players from their normal squad so they traveled to the Big Circus, found no tent, picked up some clowns and played the French in the last, meaningless game of the league for both teams.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									The referee thought the clowns were funny enough not to find his whistle on numerous occasions and our keeper decided to let the ball float into our net to keep the French smiling.&nbsp; The Swiss clowns tried to find the net on numerous occasions but instead found the bushes and fences on the outer side of the big circus much more appealing targets.&nbsp; Well, one can only say thank you to the clowns for providing the French some entertainment on the day, although I would say that the lack of tips severely upset some of our prouder Red Noses.<br>
