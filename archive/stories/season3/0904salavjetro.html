								<P>There is an old saying in Japanese, which states roughly that if everyone accepted apologies, there would be no need for the police. Sala midfielder Stephen Brooke-Smith came to understand this sentiment on Sunday. Upon rather churlishly flicking the ball away after the whistle was blown for a Jetro free kick, he found his apologies falling on deaf ears. Kazu, the man in black, reached for the yellow card and after only 4 minutes it was quite clear, TML Season 3 was well and truly underway.<br>
									Sala started the season with a new keeper in Shigehisa who showed a pretty safe pair of hands all night on the rare occasions he was called upon. Other than that it was a very familiar line up that took to the pitch to face a Jetro team who have taken a few thrashings from Sala of late.<br>
									Sala completely bossed the first half, allowing Jetro few opportunities to build phases of possession. As everyone is well aware, Jetro have some of the most skilful players in the league and are very dangerous on the break, so Sala set their stall out to break down Jetro&rsquo;s offence before it got started.<br>
									Brookey in his first game unhampered by injury for almost a year, was a man possessed, manically chasing down every Jetro pass and probably would have kicked a dog, if one had had the misfortune to run onto the pitch.<br>
									Sala maintained a controlled passing game, without ever really threatening, and so the game continued for most of the first half. Lenny and Giles enjoyed a lot of space out wide but the amount of ball they got didn&rsquo;t really do them justice.<br>
									Just as it seemed that the half would pass without real incident, Jetro made a mistake. Toby chased down a pass-back, forcing the keeper to play a sketchy ball laterally across the six yard box to his centre-half. Charles had also followed in, and when he clattered into the defender, the ball broke kindly for Toby who made the finish look a lot easier than it actually was. 1v0.<br>
									Charles was replaced by Brian at half time but other than that Sala remained unchanged, captain Guido Geisler feeling that the game was far from over.<br>
									As is usually the case on Astroturf, the legs got tired and the ball seemed to spend an increasing amount of time bouncing around the centre circle, just above the height of everyone&rsquo;s heads. The second half was not one for the purists.<br>
									Jetro were clearly the fitter team, and as Sala struggled to maintain the pace of getting forward and dropping back, gaps began to appear.<br>
									A rather hopeful through ball found a Jetro striker goal side of Clarkey and streaking through on goal. Fortunately his cross cum chip struck the bar and rebounded to safety. It was definitely one of at least 2 or 3 exciting moments in the game.<br>
									And still they came. Shots were miscued, cutbacks over hit, open goals passed up, even Captain Geisler&rsquo;s slip went unpunished when he redeemed himself with two colossal blocks. It seemed Jetro couldn&rsquo;t buy a goal, and Sala also seemed unwilling to add to their tally.<br>
									The equalising goal, when it finally came, was just the impetus the game needed to spur it on to an entertaining close.<br>
									A Jetro free kick (retaken after Brian was booked for blocking the first attempt, hardly the behaviour of a gentleman!) from the half way line was curled into the box and somehow dropped right to an unmarked red shirt who gleefully rammed it into the roof of the net from seven yards, leaving Shigehisa with no chance.<br>
									Like a boxer who can only fight well once he&rsquo;s been knocked down, Sala got off the floor and so dominated the last 15 minutes, that it was like reading the script of the Steven Seagal movie &ldquo;Under Siege&rdquo;.<br>
									Gallagher saw a snapshot flash past the post and had a header cleared off the line from a corner, Dhugal also forced the keeper into a save from a good header and Giles just couldn&rsquo;t get the ball out from under his feet as it dropped to him at the back post. Time and time again Sala contrived not to score.<br>
									After 65 minutes, Charles replaced a tired Beddingfield, who must have hit at least a century playing cricket earlier in the day to have so worn himself out (Still, judging by this years Ashes he&rsquo;s probably good enough to top the Australian batting order) Toby, who had also run himself into the ground was replaced by Doug Lee and Martin came on for Steve after a hard shift at the back.<br>
									Sala poured forward, Brookey finding his feet again in the last ten, Guido pushing through the centre and Giles and Lenny pinging balls into the middle. Brian&rsquo;s long throws were consistently flicked on by Clarkey but like a tame snake, Sala&rsquo;s strikeforce refused to bite. The last few minutes were frantic, with Jetro forced to employ an &lsquo;Out the park for medals&rsquo; approach.<br>
									Charles&rsquo;s dipping shot from Geisler&rsquo;s pass seemed destined for the back of the net but just dropped the wrong side of the bar with the keeper stranded, and Lenny&rsquo;s shot from range summed up Sala&rsquo;s misfortune as he failed to find the target.<br>
									Jetro will surely be much the happier team with a point, but in fairness they could easily have sneaked a win themselves. Despite a poor showing last season it seems they are not going to be so easily rolled over this time around.<br>
									<br>
									As the final whistle blew, the season seemed to stretch out far into the distance, Sala&rsquo;s third place finish last season already seems like a long time ago and if it is to be improved upon, sharper teeth will certainly be needed.<br>
