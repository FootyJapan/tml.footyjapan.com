									<br>
									A foul 20 yards out from goal allowed Reds midfielder Masa  to curl-in a gem of a free kick over the Shane wall and into the bottom right  corner of the goal after 25 minutes.<br>
									<br>
									The lacklustre Shane were further punished when Embassy  midfielder Satoshi pounced on an error by the Shane keeper after he spilled a  shot from Kotaro on 70 minutes to effectively finish this game off as a  contest.<br>
									<br>
									Striker Ally inspired a Shane revival, but he saw two goal  attempts thwarted by a resolute Embassy defence lead by the tenacious Gerard Brady and Mike Yeomans. While poor passing and even poorer finishing summed  up the Yellows frustration.<br>
									<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/0402befcvsha3.jpg" alt="" height="189" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="3">The Embassy have shown signs of improvement in recent  matches much to the delight of captain Tim Letheren and club manager Simon Collier.&nbsp; Shane by contrast will simply be  asking what went wrong.&nbsp; Whatever happens in the remaining matches this  season Shane have produced some good football this season and will definitely  be gunning for promotion next season.<br>
