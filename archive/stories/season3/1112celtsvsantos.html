								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 12th November.</b> Four wins on the trot now for the Celts as they continue their push for promotion to Division 1 of the TML. Still a long way to go and judging by this performance still a lot of work to do but getting results while not playing your best is always a good sign. The Celts largely dominated this game with Ben Reeder and Chris Moores comfortable at the back throughout, but failure to deliver a decent final to ball Neil Blondell or goal-a-game Ollie Petrie, who were obviously on top up front, meant a surprising lack of scoring chances for the Celts in the first half. A strong breeze across the pitch at YC&amp;AC meant most of the play (nearly all in fact) in the first half went up the Celts left wing of Seamus Hanly and John Conama, while Jeremiah Jacquet and Wayne Bentley were left out in the cold on the right. With Kieran Macgowan and Dermot Hanlon comfortable in the center of the park, it just seemed a matter of time before the Celts broke through, but instead Santos gradually clawed there way back into the game. Aki, especially considering the heavy pitch, handled a couple of long-range efforts from Santos that bounced dangerously in front of goal, very coolly. Most of the Celts chances in the first half came from outside the square, with a Hanlon effort from the edge of the square the pick of the bunch. A dangerous corner across the face of the goal should have been put away, but Celts players were caught unawares and swung hopefully at fresh air.<br>
									<br>
									The half time interlude saw the introduction of John Dermody and the artist formally known as &ldquo;Badger;&rdquo; Ben Cliffe. The first chance of the second half fell to Santos with a free kick from the edge of the square which went to the left and wide. Chances were few and far between, however a notable MacGowan header from a Jacquet corner could have been the decider. Although Dermody was introduced at the back he managed to get himself into the best scoring positions with a snapshot from the edge of the square forcing the Santos defender on the line to use his hand to block it. An automatic red card followed before Hanlon coolly put the penalty away to give the Celts a well-deserved lead. With Santos now down to just 10 men the Celts dominated the closing exchanges but still could not find the net.<br>
									<br>
									So it finished 1-0 to the Celts and while certainly not their best performance of late, it was enough to keep them on track for promotion.<br>
									<br>
									Man of the Match goes to Wayne Bently who was rock solid in defense and a genuine threat going forward.<br>
