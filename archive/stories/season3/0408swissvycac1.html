								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sat 8th April.</b> Rounding the final bend the somewhat one paced filly YCAC, out of &quot;House Party&quot; and &quot;Alarm Clock&quot;,&nbsp;pulled up lame leaving odds on favourite&nbsp;Hibs, out of &quot;Tokyo Irish&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot;,&nbsp;to win the TML stakes at a canter. Having drawn up to the leaders shoulder in February the challengers lack of stamina was exposed and she fell away fast, almost as if Wayne Rooney had backed her to win. The question now is whether the nag has the character to kick on and claim 2nd or end up unplaced.<br>
									<br>
									If the initial &nbsp;damage had been done by Sala then it was left to the Swiss to put the ailing beast out of its misery by grinding out a 1-0 victory on Saturday morning thus confirming Hibs as TML3 champs.<br>
									<br>
									Despite playing essentially the entire game in the Swiss half, YCAC failed to trouble Peter Pauli with a single shot. The only time he was called into action over the 80 minutes was to collect those YCAC free kicks that Kirk deemed harmless enough to&nbsp;let through.<br>
									<br>
									The morning didn't start auspiciously for the home side. &quot;HOUSE PARTY!!&quot; the words strike a cold clammy fear into the heart&nbsp;of even the most trusting of captains wondering where the other half of the team had got to. Shock over with, 11 on the pitch by KO with 3 more on the way, YCAC then had a very bright opening 20 minutes. Satoshi was giving the redoubtable Krando a torrid time down the right flank and Damian put in a couple of free kicks across the face of the Swiss&nbsp;6 yard box&nbsp;which should have produced a goal<br>
									<br>
									Neither did and YCAC never again looked like scoring. A Swiss defender managed it. Threading a free kick from distance right on HT past Gary Hodgson rooted to the spot unsighted by 2 Swiss running across the 6 yard box untroubled by YCAC defenders. Offside? Couldnt say, you surely have to be level with the last defender to be able to tell dont you? That was pretty much it. A surging run by Angelo ended with him screwing his shot wide of the far post otherwise the game was being played deeper and deeper in the Swiss half. Kirk circled the wagons in the Swiss penalty area as the home side fed him a strict diet of long throws and overstruck freekicks until Simon Lloyd thankfully called time.<br>
									<br>
									A day of note for the Richards family at least. 1st team YCAC regular Will was joined in the starting line up by elder brother Ed, visiting from sunny Wales (and why wouldn't you?), younger brother Tom, early for the 2nd team game and dad Neil, just in the wrong place at the wrong time. 4 from the same family is a record for YCAC 1sts.<br>
									<br>
									A forgettable day for non Richards' but an historic occasion, nevertheless. The final match played on grass at YCAC. A word for the pitch that has served faithfully since the club moved to its present site in 1912; <b>Bye!</b><br>
