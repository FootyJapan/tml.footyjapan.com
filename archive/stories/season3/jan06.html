					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 29th January.</b> YCAC Dressing Room. 20 minutes to KO.<br>
						The suddenly tough to beat Jetro are a big red machine with its motor beginning to hum as it warms up menacingly a mere 20 yards away.&nbsp; Daisuke hasn't made it off the park bench so its looking like the home team will only have 10 starters. Star midfielder Anthony Savage, 1 of the 10, is acting very strangely, unless he has been drinking vodka red bulls for 6 straight hours, in which case,&nbsp;bulging eyes and bouncing off walls would be less of a worry. Things are expected of new boy Suyama. For one, he's expected to play as there will only be 9 if he doesn't. <a class="txlink" href="0129ycacvjetro.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

						Mauritzio produced most of the attacking football in the first half, but failed to even deliver a serious shot on target. British Embassy for all their efforts weren't much better.<br>

						<br>
						It was Salas first time to take on KGFC but they looked less than fearsome as they lined up to start the game three men short.<br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 21st January.</b> Usually you can expect a game on the lush Hachijoji Park artificial pitch will not be cancelled due to weather, however, waking up of Saturday morning to near blizzard conditions and a good 5cm of snow lying on the ground in Tokyo most of the BFC squad were already planning a lazy day indoors. So it was with great surprise the call came that the game was ON.<br>

					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 15th January.</b> A double from dead ball specialist Joe Takeda was just about enough to see off the spirited challenge of the Geckoes on a cow of a YCAC pitch at lunchtime on Sunday.<br>
						<br>
						An upset looked on the cards from the get go. Contrast the 40 minutes of enthusiastic warm up by the Geckoes squad with the last minute arrival of the 10th YCAC player and the cap in hand borrowing of 2 second teamers just finishing their own fixture.<br>

The answer was yes indeed we could.<br>
						<br>
						The Hibs were vying for the fastest goal ever in the TML as Keita kicked off directly to Yasu out wide who hit the bye line and cut back for Yama to smash in after 5.43 seconds. <a class="txlink" href="0114hibsvkgfc.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>

					<p><b>7~9th January.</b> Whether it's New Year resolutions or just a new run of form, the 2 bottom clubs in Div 2 surprised their higher placed opponents with resounding victories in the opening matches of 2006. Third placed Barbarians were looking to be challlenging for the top spot when they faced bottom place Maritizio, only to suffer a 4-0 defeat that helped the latter up 3 places, while the Dutch Embassy also moved up with a 3-1 win over Santos FC. Although JETs are still in the top spot and hoping for promotion this year, there are still 6 matches to go for most teams and anything could happen.<br>

					<p><b>OiFuto dirt, Sun 8th January.</b> Sala were left feeling a bit sorry for themselves after scraping a narrow 3v2 win over a plucky Geckoes team, when it emerged in post match debate, that no less than six Sala players had scored during the game. After lengthy dialogue with the referee however, it turned out that (unsurprisingly) at least three people had been lying. Although absent through suspension, Lenny claimed all six assists by s&eacute;ance before the mistake could be rectified and now rockets to the top of Sala's all time assist table with 118.<br>
						<br>
						The reason for the confusion surrounding the goals was that neither team could muster enough gumption to cleanly send the ball over the goal line, until a strong header from a Geckoes' Rob Hughes in the last minute had Sala nervously glancing at the clock. <a class="txlink" href="0108salavgek.html" target="_blank">more ...<br>
