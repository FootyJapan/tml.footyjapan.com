								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 5th March.</b> Kanto Celts won their 10th straight league game with a 4-1 demolition of the Dutch Embassy at a sunny YCAC.<br>
									After a slow start, the Celts gradually began to take control and took the lead midway through the half when Adam fired in a cross from the left, Soh lept, chested down and finished into the bottom right hand corner. Less than 5 minutes later it was 2, and an even better goal. Dermot knocked down and Soh smacked a beautiful half-volley past the despairing dive of the Dutch keeper. <br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/06/0305celtsvdet.jpg" alt="" height="189" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">For a few minutes after that the Celts lost their way a little, perhaps distracted by Captain Dermots repeated requests to touch him, which sent several children running back to their parents in a panicked state. The loss of concentration was almost exposed when the Dutch broke through only for Aki to react quickly and make a great save.<br>
									Unfortunately the warning wasnt heeded and an unneccessary penalty was given away. Aki saved superbly only for the Dutch striker to be first to the rebound to smack home. Game on again. Half time 2-1. <br>
									The second half saw better football from the Celts, Soh doing plenty of damage up front was denied a hattrick when his header was cleared off the line.<br>
									The Celts weren't to be denied however and when a Fumi cross was handled by the Dutch defender. Dermot despatched the resulting penalty confidently for some breathing space. It got even better 10 minutes later when the Italian wizard Roberto pulled a superb free kick from his bag of tricks. <br>
									<br>
									Cruising at 4-1 the Celts made several substitutions, but remained in full control of the game. All in all a confident display by the Celts who know now that a win v Shane on Sunday will see them promoted with a game to spare and also give a great shot at winning the league outright.<br>
									Other teams will talk about games in hand perhaps, but at this stage of the season its points on the board that matter and the Celts are looking good.<br>
									<br>
									Man of the Match - Soh Nakata, followed closely by Roberto.<br>
