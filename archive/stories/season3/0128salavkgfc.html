								<p><b>OiFuto dirt, Sat 28th January.</b> Salas run of good results continued last Saturday (Black Saturday asides) on a breezy morning at Oifuto. The pitch was still recovering from the previous weeks snowfall and the far touchline was intermittently frozen and in parts, swampy.<br>
									<br>
									It was Salas first time to take on KGFC but they looked less than fearsome as they lined up to start the game three men short.<br>
									<br>
										Sala took this opportunity by the horns, going one nil up inside five minutes. A neat interchange in the Sala midfield opened up space for Brookey on the left to fire in a pinpoint cross, which (Colombian debutant) Andres met on the bounce to nod past the on coming keeper. 1v0<br>
										After that, the game became a little bogged down in the midfield, as two more late arrivals bolstered KGFCs ranks to 10, almost a fair fight.<br>
										Having opened his account for Sala after barely five minutes in a white shirt, Andres should have had a second midway through the half, but blasted over from ten yards when well placed. Dhugal also had a good chance when he rose lithely to meet Brookeys inviting cross, but his header flashed wide.<br>
										Following that, Toby, Brian and Brookey had several series of neat passing but never quite managed to sculpt a clear chance.<br>
										KGFC then controlled much of the possession, but never looked like scoring until a speculative 40 yard dipping volley surprised Sid. The Silver Fox just did enough to tip it onto the bar only to suffer the ignominy of having it rebound off the back of his head and into the net. The only person who looked more shocked than Sid was the KGFC midfielder who struck it. 1v1<br>
										Sala weren&rsquo;t behind for long. After a decent spell of possession, Toby's through ball was mis-controlled by Charles and fortunately broke to Giles who lashed it home from about the penalty spot, whilst the KGFC defender who stood almost directly between him and goal raised his hand for one of the most optimistic offside shouts in living memory. 2v1<br>
										Charles had another slice of luck soon afterwards when his hooked through-pass, intended for Toby on the left was completely sclaffed and dropped temptingly in front of  the charging Dhugal, who gleefully danced clean through only for his shot to be blocked by a combination of defender and keeper.<br>
										Before half time, halfway-line goal scoring hero Douglas Lee Esq. picked up his first ever yellow card in 38 years of playing football, after an NFL style block.<br>
										KGFC came out in the second half and put on a valiant display, considering they had been a man short or more, for the whole game. The expected tiring out of their wingers and wingbacks failed to materialize and Sala had to work hard to close out the match.<br>
										Doug Lee, Guido and Yusuke held a resolute line which the diminutive KGFC strikers found hard to break down, whilst Lenny, Giles and later Andres ran tirelessly (or somewhat tirelessly) up and down the flanks. It was this endeavor which led to Salas third and game ending goal. Giles played in Charles on the right flank, and when his cut back was blocked, the ball ricocheted high into the air to be met with a crisp volley by Dhugal, on the edge of the box, that arrowed (Squirmed?) into the bottom left corner. 3v1<br>
										Unlike the usual script of every Sala game since nineteen oatcake, there was no last minute panicking, no backs-to-the-wall defending, and no selling of cheap goals at the death. As KGFC eventually began to tire, Sala knocked the ball around well and kept long periods of possession to wrap up the game.<br>
										Perhaps with a full compliment of players, KGFC will fancy there chances in the league rematch, but Sala were also far from their best.<br>
										Salas recent progress will face a significant examination next Sunday in le crunch against the French at Misato.<br>
									<br>
									Apologies for the lack of punctuation, but Toby's computer lives in a completely different dimension from his keyboard.<br>
