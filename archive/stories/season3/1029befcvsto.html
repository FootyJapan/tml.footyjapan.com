								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 29th October.</b> A very wet and skiddy surface played host to a classic TML 2nd Division fixture on Saturday, with new boys Stoneds walking away with the points.&nbsp; The match started brightly enough for the BEFC boys, unlike the weather, as Kotaro, Silvano and Mike Yeomans tore the Stoneds defence apart on the left side of the park and should have been two or even three goals ahead after the first fifteen minutes.&nbsp; But it was Stoneds who struck first blood after 20 minutes with a swift counter attack, one of their midfielders gleefully dancing through the BEFC defence to score a well taken goal.<br>
									<br>
									BEFC felt rather aggrieved having conceded so easily and were once more on the ascendancy. An innocuous challenge in midfield led to a free kick some forty yards from the Stoneds goal.&nbsp; Mike Yeomans stepped up and unleashed a stylish, curling right foot shot over the Stoneds wall and past a stunned and inanimate keeper to nestle in the top left corner of the net.&nbsp; However, the ecstasy was short lived as Stoneds then scored a reasonable free kick of their own to go 2-1 ahead.&nbsp; Five Minutes later, Stoneds added a third through some soft defending, as the striker hit a nasty shot from just inside the area that skidded with pace past a despairing Keith Crowley in the BEFC goal.<br>
									<br>
									Half time came and went and BEFC settled down in the second half to produce some nice flowing football.&nbsp; Stoneds attacks were reduced to rapid counter attacks, but with both sides determined to win the overall game it was a very open affair and played in a reasonable spirit despite the now teeming rain.&nbsp; BEFC should have scored on at least four more occasions, but for poor finishing, resolute defending and some brilliant goalkeeping, Stoneds managed to hang on for the three points.<br>
									<br>
									Stoneds played some good football at times and are a well organized and determined side and should be serious promotion contenders this season.&nbsp; BEFC despite their slick movement and passing are finding Division 2 life tough at the moment, their problem lies in the fact that they have no regular proven striker and goals from open play have been rare for them so far this season.&nbsp;<br>
