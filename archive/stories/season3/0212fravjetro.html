								<p><b>Katsushika, Sun 12th February.</b> A bright and sunny typical Japanese morning saw the return leg of Jetro vs France FC at 9 am on Katsushika dirt pitch. The French had their typical lineup apart from two key midfielders missing and their 3rd different keeper between the posts in two games! <br>
									<br>
									Anyway the first half saw the most composed and serious performance from the French side so far this....decade, with all lines contributing to both the offensive and defensive phases. An even more difficult feat to accomplish against the usual very fit and slick passing Jetro-style football. On top of that, the front line was suddenly as threatening as ever with Etsushi knocking the ball home after running onto a through ball, first rebounding it off their advancing keeper, then sprinting to score from 20 Yards inside the side netting. 1 - 0 France. <br>
									<br>
									Jetro were limited to a couple of corner kicks one of them punched wide by the keeper and a shot that went wide of the goal. Anyway, after a great long range effort from Julien almost going in, Etsushi managed to lob the Jetro keeper as a final touch to very good passing move. 2 - 0 seconds before half time, out of 3 chances, that's a first.<br>
									<br>
									The second half saw the French a bit more on the back foot, with Jetro playing more aggressively, piling some pressure on our back four for the first 20 minutes. A quick counter attack from the French goal line through the midfield all the way to the far right side allowed Ludo to fire a cracking missile from 25 yards out on the edge of the box for the ball to crash in the roof of the goal.<br>
									 <br>
									<b>Wow what a goal</b> (some joked that a cross had been intended but that was surely  plain jealousy). <br>
									<br>
									The 3 goal advantage did not last as a Jetro midfielder after quick foot skills ran past the defense to wrong foot the advancing French keeper. 3 - 1 with 20minutes to go. <br>
									<br>
									The game was much more open now going from one goal to the other, both keeper left however with basic saves. That is until a 40 yard free kick from Francois crashed onto the bar only for Etsuhi to head the ball in. 4 - 1 and a great hat-trick. <br>
									Despite a strong team performance, the obvious man of the match is Etsushi, but probably paired with L Frich performance as an all round left back all over the pitch.<br>
									<br>
									Thanks to Simon Lloyd for keeping the game under control, both teams however playing competitive but fair soccer. The second source of satisfaction is another clean yellow-card-sheet for the &quot;fair-french&quot; team, eager to pass on the wooden spoon at this year's award party.<br>
									<br>
									Next, Ze cup, Olly and Trent see you then and bring it on!!!<br>
