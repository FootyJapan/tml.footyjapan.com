								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 26th November.</b> Hoping to take some inspiration from the late, great George Best the mood in the camp was good ahead of this Saturday afternoon clash with lowly Jetro. A solid squad of 13 were thinking that this was the day the 3 game loosing streak would surely end.<br>
									<br>
									The game started well with the BFC on the attack, having good spells of possession in the opposition half, a host of chances came and went but the Jetro keeper was never properly tested. As half time approached Jetro made a rare foray in to the BFC half - a loose ball failed to be cleared and somehow broke to an unmarked Jetro forward who fired home from 12 yards. <br>
									<br>
									A rallying call to the troops at half time seemed to have an temporary effect as the BFC came out for the second half but the early goal they were hoping for failed to materialize. The wind was taken out of the BFC sails as a Jetro break was clinically finished to give them a 2 goal lead. <br>
									With a good 25 minutes remaining there was still time for a comeback but a lack of confidence and creativity resulted in only one clear cut chance for the BFC which brought a fine save from the Jetro Keeper. The game was finished off when a well worked free kick by Jetro resulted in a third late on.<br>
									 <br>
									The ref had a good game and did very well to break up a post match sit-in by the BFC as they contemplated their future and in particular next Sundays cup tie against the Hibs. Even in the hot and cold world that is the BFC five defeats in a row is unthinkable - lets make sure come next Sunday evening we are basking in the Caribbean sun rather than a Siberian wasteland.&nbsp;<br>
