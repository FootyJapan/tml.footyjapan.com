								<p><b>Big Circus, Sat 22nd April.</b> YCAC got back to winning ways with a comfortable 4-1 victory over the French at Big Circus on Saturday night. Six thirty KO on a saturday seems like a plan particularly when it&nbsp;sometimes appears that 1/2 your team doesn't own an alarm clock but in reality it just gives team management a whole days headache putting together a team instead of the usual hour or so panic before KO<br>
									<br>
									15 on Tuesday, list closed, 10 on Saturday morning, phones red hot-you gotta love high schoolers (well you would if not for the restraining order). Still 10 on the Tomei but miraculously 11 at KO and 12 by HT. Respect Joe Takeda! Its truely amazing how many decent footballers he went to school with. They must have had a hell of school team<br>
									<br>
									Back to the mountains and a slightly disappointing surface, just to keep that theme going, more St Marys than Hachijoji, but it seemed to suit YCAC more than the French. With Joe pushed up and Satoshi and another of Joe's alumni, Kitajima, on the flanks, YCAC were nimble to put it mildly. With ball to feet and playing off Gav and James, these 3 gave the bigger French defenders a torrid evening. YCAC were 3 up before the 1/2 hour mark. The 1st 2 tap ins for messrs Absolom and Suyama after some top approach play at speed. The 3rd was a scramble, in from close range off some blokes knee. Dickie Philo, stand-in center half, claimed the last touch and was credited with the goal. It must be said here that Dickie, not overly blessed with footballing skills as&nbsp;i'm sure he would be the 1st to admit, has done marvelously over the last few months filling some pretty big shoes in the heart of the YCAC defence. A place in the 16 must be found for him even when the regulars are back<br>
									<br>
									The YCAC boys came in to a HT talk glowing with confidence and totally on top of the French, tactically and physically. 5 minutes of&nbsp;tinkering and Churchillian inspiration from the YCAC coaching staff and the French were completely in charge as soon as the 2H kicked off. They plundered a quick goal with 2 credited assists from YCAC defenders and were looking a fair bet to make a game of it.<br>
									<br>
									Not that the Manager shouldnt take some responsibility for this turn of events but there may also have been some strange magnetic forces at work at times too. Wasnt The Ring set in these hills?. At one point in the 2H, for example,&nbsp;the YCAC Right Back, lets just call him Phil Denham for convenience, was neck and neck with the French winger chasing a ball into the corner. Suddenly they entered into some sort of magnetic field and a pulse of energy threw the winger forward at speed and dragged &quot;Phil&quot; back.&nbsp;For all the world it looked like &quot;Phil&quot; was running on the spot and there was suddenly 20&nbsp;yards between him and his man&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									The storm, magnetic and otherwise, passed&nbsp;over though as suddenly as it had blown up and YCAC had things pretty much their own way for the last 25 minutes. During this time Satoshi ran riot amongst the tiring French defence and created a hatful of chances for both himself and his teammates, all spurned. It was left to Ken Sakae to drive through the right hand channel on his own and plant the 4th goal across the gallant French keeper into the bottom corner to round off the night.<br>
