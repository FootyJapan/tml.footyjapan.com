								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 29th October.</b> The match up Saturday between YC&amp;AC1 and BFC, both undefeated so far, was an early season test for both talented teams.<br>
									<br>
									Play was spirited throughout as both teams' defenses came out strong and solid.&nbsp; Nothing further got past YCAC defenders, Damian Hart, Nicholas McDonald, Dickie Philo and Kevin Morgan, or the goalkeeping of Gary Hodgson. BFC's punishing defense was impenetrable too, led by experienced Leigh Manson, Ryo Yasunaga, and Dave Long and Jon Best.<br>
									<br>
									However the 0-0 stalemate was broken midway through the second half as YC&amp;ACs stand-in skipper and token Scot, Damian Hart, thundered a 30yard free-kick directly into the roof of the BFC net to put the home team in front, 1-0. Damo, deputising with Steve Taw selflessly scouting for new talent in Wanchai, staked a strong claim for the coveted Skippers job fulltime.<br>
									<br>
									YC&amp;AC1 continued to put pressure on goal numerous times through corner-kicks but were turned back by BFC's tenacious goalie Jyurki. BFC tried to set the pace throughout playing their speedstars, Evans Kunyuga and Jonathan Day, who usually demonstrate sharp dribbling skills, but the team just couldn't break through for a goal. The score remained 1-0, leaving YC&amp;AC1 not only one of the teams that are left undefeated besides the Hibs, but also the only one that remains without any goals conceded.<br>
									<br>
									Unanimous praise for YC&amp;AC1 defender Dickie Philo who was singled out for his outstanding performance, while BFC displayed remarkable team spirit not wilting until the very last minute.<br>
