								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 25th February.</b> A scheduling misdemeanor by the league office produced back to back matches for the Swiss and the Hibs.&nbsp; One week after squeaking by the Hibs. 1-0 in a Cup battle at YCAC, Sid sent us to the darker side of Tokyo to see what would happen on the turf. &nbsp;Both teams had to deal with numerous player changes due to injuries/absences from the previous match but the Hibs. did see a return of their enormous captain from suspension.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The first half of the match was similar to last week&rsquo;s encounter, with the smooth passing of the Hibs. enabling them to keep possession. The Swiss back four was able to clear it out for about 30 minutes but their forwards couldn&rsquo;t maintain possession up front. &nbsp;The Hibs. just keep coming at you wave after wave, the difference this time around was that both of their forwards were missing thus no clear target man or finisher.&nbsp; The first opportunity of the match fell to Swiss midfielder Kai after a great through ball by Dave Pratt, he burst through the left for a 1 on 1 vs. Hitoshi in goal.&nbsp; A beautiful goal bound chip over the keeper bounced cruelly off the crossbar, to be cleared away to safety.&nbsp; Following that lone chance, the Swiss became more frustrated with five Hibs. in midfield and their continuous pressure. &nbsp;The dam finally broke with a great overlapping run by Josh on the left, a perfectly weighted cross was flicked in with the outside of his foot, surprising everyone with a neat chip into the right hand side of the goal. 1-0 to the Hibs.&nbsp; The rest of the half saw the physical side of the match and Ricky, the ultimate Ref, was called on a little too frequently.&nbsp; The Swiss were getting frustrated and the Hibs. were dominant.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The 2H saw some changes to the Swiss lineup and a little bit more determination. &nbsp;Raffaelle, one of the Swiss defenders, pushed into midfield to counter the extra man while the Swiss passing out of the back started to find willing runners up front.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Hibs were looking good in back and in midfield but lacking that run/or finisher in the box. &nbsp;All of their chances came from distance and were picked out easily by Swiss keeper Uchida.&nbsp; The game was relatively even until a penetrating ball, again by Dave P., found Rafaelle in the box with 20 minutes gone.&nbsp; He beat his defender but was brought down in the process. &nbsp;Ricky ended up pointing straight to the penalty spot. &nbsp;Dave P. stepped up and smacked it high and into the corner to make it 1-1. &nbsp;This seemed to spark the Swiss into more movement and even better passing. &nbsp;They started to get through midfield and were playing with more purpose while the Hibs. seemed more determined but were still without any idea in the final 3rd &#150; they probably would have done better to push Bevan or Jay into an attacking role but decided to play it out, seemingly not too worried about a draw.&nbsp; Instead, it was the Swiss who a mere 5 minutes later sent a long ball through &#150; it was chased down by Yan and Ricky judged that he was muscled off the ball just outside the penalty area.&nbsp; Free kick 20 meters out and Dave P. lined up with 9 Hibs. and the always dominant Hitoshi to get by.&nbsp; Dave struck it beautifully, leaving Hitoshi wrong footed as he went right while Dave curled it over the wall into the left hand side of the goal, 2-1 to the Swiss with 13 minutes to go.&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The rest of the game was tense with the Hibs. pushing forward aggressively, even Hitoshi coming up to attack and leaving themselves exposed at the back.&nbsp; The back 3 of the Swiss, Koin, Trevor, and Suzuki were superb with Trevor dominant in the air in spite of his 38 years.&nbsp; The final whistle went with the Swiss relieved that it was over but it was another great effort which saw them come from behind.&nbsp; Dave Pratt&rsquo;s two goals were fantastic but Trevor in defense was dominant and it was his play throughout which kept the Swiss close.&nbsp; Though many thought the Swiss were finished and the Hibs. already had their name on the trophy, it is starting to look a little more interesting.&nbsp; Still all to play for with 6 games to go in the league and the semis. of the Cup approaching.<br>
