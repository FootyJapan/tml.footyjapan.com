								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sat 5th November.</b> Fresh from 2 victories in the Mets league, sandwiching a further victory in a non Mets game, Barbarians were feeling confident and hoping to extend their winning streak to 4 games. Playing top of the table Saitama Jets, undefeated in their opening 5 games was always going to be tough and bound to produce some fireworks in this Guy Fawkes day clash<br>
									<br>
									The difference in the 2 sides might have been predicted before the match had even kicked off. Saitama Jets were on the pitch well before KO, fully kitted and doing team warm ups and stretches. Barbarians on the other hand were still standing on the sidelines in their underpants 15 minutes AFTER scheduled kick off time waiting for their kit and the last 5 players to show up. Barbarians were sticking to their 5 year principles of this is only for fun, not going too take it too seriously.<br>
									<br>
									Barbs eventually fielded a full squad of Kaz in goal, Fred &amp; Fergs in central defence with Muramoto &amp; Steve making up the back four. Starting midfield was Richard, Rouven, John Stokes &amp; Hideyuki with Danny &amp; Mark up front. On the bench was Hiro, Hugo, Jimmy &amp; Leon with Hideki also arriving at half time for a late run out<br>
									<br>
									The game started 20 minutes late but at a pace that seemed as though it was trying to catch up. Frantic end to end stuff saw Jets have a couple of early chances but it was Barbarians that got the first shot on target when Mark picked up the ball in midfield, danced thru a couple of attempted tackles and threaded the ball thru the middle to Rouven who still had plenty to do. Rouven took his chance well and his low shot beat the keeper at the near post giving Barbs the lead after just 6 or 7 minutes<br>
									<br>
									This was like lighting a firecracker up the Jets backside who came out on rocket fuel in an attempt to get the equaliser. The Jets thundered in a couple of long range shots that were only just off target and brought a couple of good saves out of the dependable Kaz in the BaBas goal. Barbarians had chances of their own too. John Stokes lost his marker and rose unchallenged to Freds corner kick only to see his header well off target. Minutes later some good midfield play on the edge of the box ended with a pass to Stokes who was perfectly positioned for a crack at goal but sadly the brand new boots did not repay the investment and he sent a firecracker well wide<br>
									<br>
									With 10 minutes of the first half still to go Jets won a free kick about 25 metres out. The kick taken low beat the wall and was heading for the bottom right corner of the goal, Kaz got down well and looked to have it covered but the ball sneaked under his arm and just inside the post for the equaliser. Jets full of confidence pushed forward again and only a fine one handed save to the same bottom right corner stopped them going in at the break with the lead<br>
									<br>The 2nd half started off at the same frantic pace as the first, both sides getting forward as much as possible but Jets probably had more of the midfield play and looked more threatening. 15 minutes in they got their breakthrough. Barbarians seemed to have broken down another Jets attack but a Barbs midfielder was caught on the ball just outside the box and a quick shot saw Kaz go down at full stretch to make a fine save but unfortunately he couldn't hold on to the ball and it spilled across the goal. Jets reacted more quickly and pounced on it for a 2 metre tap in and the lead.<br>
									<br>
									Barbarians pushed forward and produced some danger but could not convert it into a goal. With 5 minutes to go Jets should have wrapped it all up but squandered a chance in front of an open goal. The last 2 minutes saw a Barbarians free kick from around the same position that Jets had scored. Freds inch perfect delivery beat the wall and was about to dip under the bar for the equaliser when the goalie got a hand to it to push it over for a corner. More drama in the dying seconds as a fine cross from Muramoto to the back post saw Rouven charging in at speed, he caught the ball on the volley and had the shot been on target it would have ripped thru the back of the net but agonisingly Barbarians watched it rocket past the upright inches wide. Final score Saitama Jets 2, Barbarians 1<br>
