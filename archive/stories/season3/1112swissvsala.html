								<p><b>Big Circus Sat 12th November.</b> Both teams were left to rue the missed opportunites of a pulsating match, out in the mountains of Hon Atsugi, which finished in an unbelievable 0v0 draw.<br>
									<br>
									Last years champions looked sharp from the start, and struck the bar with 2 long(ish!) range shots in the first 5 or 10 minutes. Another drive from the edge of the box brushed the paintwork minutes later and it seemed that Sala had their hands full. But despite a summer hangover which marred Salas early season form, they have of late started looking more like the team that finished third in the league for the last two seasons.<br>
									<br>
									With four rotating strikers, Sala were deliberately running themselves into the ground, and soon the pace began to tell on the Swiss back line.  Brookeys excellent run and cross from the left pinpointed Toby who had lost his marker, but the Maryland Mauler somehow headed wide when it seemed easier to score.<br>
									<br>
									Sala piled on more pressure toward the end of the half, but to no avail.<br>
									<br>
									In the second half, there was less controlled football from either team, but again Swiss enjoyed a host of chances early on that Sala were lucky to survive.  Sala seemed happy to kick the ball anywhere as long as it was going up the pitch. The combination of Dhugal, Toby and Brookey soon began to click in the offensive areas however.<br>
									<br>
									Dhugals through ball set Toby free on about 65 minutes and although he finished well, it was called back for what must have been a very close offside decision.<br>
									<br>
									Towards the end of the game it looked more and more like Sala would nick three points, but a miss by Kirk at the other end reminded them that was foolish thinking against the Swiss.<br>
									There were head in hands moments a plenty for both sets of players.<br>
									<br>
									Eventually the Swiss defense ran out of steam though and in the last five minutes several chances fell Salas way. Brookeys shot cracked the bar from the angle of the box, Shigeru almost ran the length of the pitch, and Brookeys last gasp chip over the last man was charged down.<br>
									<br>
									Swiss deserve credit for putting on such a display with only one substitute and will probably feel they should have won the game. But Sala also showed that they are back, and a force to be reckoned with. Defensively thats two clean sheets in a row against two of the toughest teams in the league and praise should go to Sid, Clarkey, Guido, Yusuke, Doug, Steve and Brian for last weekends effort.<br>
									<br>
									Its starting to look like a season.<br>
