								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sun 12th March.</b> Second half goals from Anthony Savage and skipper Joe Takeda gave YCAC a hard won victory over a resolute and skilfull KGFC side on Sunday. Credit to both teams for putting on a decent show in&nbsp;difficult conditions. The problems of playing football on a hard and bumpy pitch were compounded by a strong gusting wind. Just to rub it in the 2&nbsp;elements even joined forces occasionally; the wind lifting up the top surface and hurling it spitefully into the players faces.<br>
									<br>
									Despite this, or maybe because of it, both teams eschewed route 1 football in favour of a measured passing game building patiently and largely constructively through the midfield.<br>
									<br>
									KGFC brought their best squad as YCAC had always expected. Tim Takeda, KGFCs captain, was never going to let brother Joe get away with an easy victory and seemed to have &quot;put the band back together&quot; with most if not all of last years team on show. While still not quite able on the day to pinch points from YCAC, the League table would surely be making easier reading if Tim had managed to get these 13 players out more often this season. The pick of the bunch was Tsuyoshi the KGFC centre forward who, despite appearances (tights and gloves in March?), is a tough and able competitor. He might have changed the course of the game 20 minutes in when he latched onto a defensive mistake and drove a fierce left footer towards the top corner of the net from the edge of the box. SuperHero Gary Hodgson (who perhaps should don a cape and tights) was equal to it though and fair flew across his goal to get the strong hand on it and put it safely over the bar.<br>
									<br>
									YCAC were happy to turn around at 0-0 and have the wind at their backs for the 2nd half. It was always a close contest but the home side began to take charge and create the better chances. The KGFC keeper was the busier and made a stunning save of his own, turning away a header from 1 of his own defenders. Eventually though the wind and sharp shooting of Anthony and Joe got the better of him as curling left footers found the top corner of his net<br>
									<br>
									2-0 it finished. YCAC&nbsp;keep ahead of the pack chasing the Hibs and KGFCs hole becomes just a little deeper. 5 games to go though for both teams and everything to play for.<br>
