					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 25th February.</b> A scheduling misdemeanor by the league office produced back to back matches for the Swiss and the Hibs.&nbsp; One week after squeaking by the Hibs. 1-0 in a Cup battle at YCAC, Sid sent us to the darker side of Tokyo to see what would happen on the turf. &nbsp;Both teams had to deal with numerous player changes due to injuries/absences from the previous match but the Hibs. did see a return of their enormous captain from suspension. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season3/0225swissvhibs.html" target="_blank">more from Swiss ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 18th February.</b> Advocators of football as art suffered a heavy moral defeat on Saturday, as Sala edged a tense encounter in Saitama. BFC just couldn&rsquo;t find a way past an obstinate Sala back line, and so an early second half goal against the run of play, helped Sala to a first win over the British since the last game of last season. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season3/0218salavbfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>OiFuto 1, Sat 18th February.</b> In a battle between two of the top sides in Division 2, second-placed Saitama Jets overcame third-placed Stoneds in a 5-4 thriller. Going into the game, these two sides were the highest-scorers in the division, so it would have been a brave man who predicted a low-scoring game. As it was, the Jets coasted into a 5-2 lead in the second half before falling asleep and conceding two in a hectic last few minutes.<br>
						Watching the Celts fluke their way past the Barbarians in the previous game meant that this was again a game the Jets had to win (just kidding, hooped fellas!) <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season3/0218jetsvstoneds.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>OiFuto 1, Sat 18th February.</b> The Celts kept up their relentless charge towards division 1, with a 9th straight victory in the league. Indeed since the horror show opening 20 minutes in the very first game of the season V Jets, when 4 goals were let in, the Celts have conceded only 5 more goals in over 9 and a half games.<br>
						Barbarians v Celts games are always keenly fought, and the Barbs seemed well up for it judging by the mini-army of players they brought along. The Celts, for the second game running suffering late withdrawals of key players, nervously awaited the arrival of 2 players who committed the schoolboy error of getting on the express monorail to Haneda.<br>
						The opening exchanges were tight, the only chance coming when Magoo struck a shot that was well saved by Fred in the Barbs goal.<br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sun 12th February.</b> An informed neutral contemplating this fixture might have predicted the decisive protagonists would be the talented and physically intimidating Shane no. 11, or the Clash debutante libero Nori.<br>
						While both acquitted themselves with distinction, the decisive factor came from an unexpected quarter &#150; the elements.<br>
						Gale-force winds swept across the open expanses of Misato forcing both sides to adjust their tactics towards the conditions rather than each other. Flying in the face of received wisdom, each half was dominated by the team playing into the wind.<br>
						Shane&rsquo;s mid-table position belied their potential as champions of this league. With a few games-in-hand on league-leaders Kanto Celts, <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season3/0212clashvshane.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The Celts lacked a few regulars but the boys who came along gave it everything.<br>
						John Conama in goal was solid, and a vital save just before the end of the first half swung things for the Celts. <a class="txlink" href="http://footyjapan.com/archive/stories/season3/0212celtsvmar.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The match started off with KGFC keeping the ball on the ground, which allowed them to keep control for long periods of time.

						<br>
						France turned up in a shiny new white strip, as opposed to their regular blue, quite without warning, leaving the two teams to jan-ken for the right to wear white. Typically, Sala lost, and were forced to take to the field wearing a motley assortment of t-shirts and jackets.<br>
