								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 20th November.</b> YCAC climbed to 2nd place in the league standings with a comfortable 3-0 win thanks to some clinical finishing over a toothless Jetro side. <br>
									Selecting the team at YCAC is never an easy job. Selecting the squad is easy, but team selection usually depends on who from the squad has turned up in time to play. This week was no different for stand in skipper&rsquo;, Phil (Alan Ball) Denham. Ten minutes to KO and only 10 to choose from and not a goalkeeper in sight. At KO YCAC managed to scrape the bare 11. <br>
									<br>
									The game was scrappy to begin with. Both teams struggled to come to terms with the Bowling Green surface. The only chance in the opening exchanges fell to James Absalom (the spell correction in MS Word defaults Absalom to Asylum!!!), a cross from the right allowed James to rise above the Jetro defence and glance a header off the far post. With the late arrival of Gary back in between the posts, YCAC began to control the game and heap pressure on the oppositions defence. Jumpei managed to wriggle clear in front of goal to guide the ball past the despairing dive of the Jetro goalkeeper to make it 1-0. <br>
									<br>
									The YCAC dominated possession in the second half. The midfield 4 managed to put their foot on the ball, pick their passes and cause Jetro a lot of problems. James Absalom took his tally for the season to 5 with two very well taken finishes. <br>
									YCAC took their foot off the gas in the latter stages, but were never troubled at the back. 5 league games and 3 clean sheets with only 2 conceded, well-done boys.<br>
