								<p><b>Oi Futo1, Saturday 17th June.</b> YCAC vs WS Geckoes wrapped up TML 3 at Oi Futo on Saturday morning; YCAC running out comfortable&nbsp;winners. Though a poor run for YCAC in April had spoiled the organizers hopes of a last day title decider with the Hibs, there was still plenty at stake almost up until the last kick of the season.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The Geckoes, outgunned in the 1H and turning round 0-4 down, played the last 40 minutes of their season knowing that a 6 goal losing margin would see them and not KGFC relegated to Div2. YCAC hasn't put 6 past anyone since Graeme Lanes glory days so the smart money was on KGFC to make the drop at the start of play, especially as YCAC/Geckoes games have always been tight affairs.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									4-0 by HT though and with Daisuke Ogawa&nbsp;having his way with the hapless Geckoes defence&nbsp;the smart money looked very silly all of a sudden. The Geckoes stuck with it though and managed to cut off the supply line to YCACs suddenly, not to mention belatedly, deadly forward line.&nbsp;The scorers werent troubled further&nbsp;and the Geckoes clung on to their TML1 status sending the talented but&nbsp;seemingly unreliable&nbsp;KGFC squad straight back down. Should be a good speech from them again at the end of season bash.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Sorry Tim Takeda! YCAC&nbsp;gave it a shot and&nbsp;equalled their best win of the year but couldnt quite find another 2 goals. Ironic that the 1 point deducted through not fufilling a fixture with the Hibs should prove so crucial. Those 2 squads are not too disimilar in make up and skills. The Hibs got their guys out every week and walk off with the title, KGFC didnt and are headed back to TML2<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									YCAC finished runners up, 5 points adrift of the Hibs, which, I think, is as close as we got all season. Player of the Season was GK Gary Hodgson. 12 goals conceded in 21 games made that a straightforward decision.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									See you all on July 1st in Legends and/or in September for TML 4.<br>
