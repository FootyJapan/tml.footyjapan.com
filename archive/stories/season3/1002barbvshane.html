									<br>
									Shane came into the game on the back of handing out a 7-0 humping in their previous game while Barbs had been unable to play their previous 2 matchs due to rain. It was always going to be a close game with the 3 previous encounters between the 2 teams ending in 1 win a piece and 1 draw.<br>
									<br>
									The heat seemed to take the pace out of the game from the start, but it was Shane who threatened first when a shite clearance from Ferg saw the ball sliced across the Barbs 18 yards line and a couple of passes found the Shane striker in space....only for him to hammer the ball off the underside of the bar. Lucky escape for Barbarians.<br>
									<br>
									Soon after though, new signing 'Jaffa' provided the ideal ball across the face of the goal for other new signing Jimmy to slot home on his debut.<br>
									<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/05/1002barbvshane3.jpg" alt="" height="243" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">
									1-0 the half ended. However, within 5 minutes of the re-start Shane were back level as their midfilder strolled into the box unnmarked to head home giving Kaz no chance.<br>
									<br>
									Jaffa the provider then turmed provider for himself, picking up the ball midway in the Shane half and running into the box leaving 3 defenders in his wake before cooly slotting past the keeper.<br>
									<br>
									Shane never a team to line down though kept the pressure on, only a timely intervention from Clarke preventing them getting the equaliser.<br>
									<br>
									2-1 Barbs. 3 points from a possible 3.<br>
									<br>
									Man of the match: Jaffa<br>
									<br>
									<b>Ferg</b><br>
