								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 29th October.</b> Our second 3-2 loss of the season following last week's hard fought 0-0 draw. <br>
									Ryuji was disappointed with the result but once more there was a lot of good to take away from the game. The difference between the halves was surprising since we added no new players but just shuffled people around. <br>
									We started with Jonathon in goal, Nick, Paul, Steve and Neil across the back. This back row stayed the same for the entire game which shows how solid and dependable they were. The center 2 anchor it with size and dependability and a fair amount of weight. <br>
									Nick played well popping up as a sweeper role on many occasions, and Neal was clearly the man of the match. So much so that towards the end of the game one of the Celts forwards scissor kicked his feet from him in simple frustration as Neal glided up the field once more having intercepted an attack, side stepped a few players and charged from the box with the ball. <br>
									Midfield saw a lot of changes throughout as did the forwards, with the pace tiring us out and forcing a series of substitutions. Alex played a stormer and looks to be one of the key players for us this season. In addition Ryuji, Rob - me - , Mike, Viv, Tomas, Amos, Michael,<br>
									<br>
									Zander, Budda and Ming Sung saw action. <br>
									Up front Amos, Michael, Ming Sung and Rob had spells. This is one area where we don't have a natural choice player. Most of us feel more comfortable in defense, midfield or the wings and perform a lot better in that role. <br>
									The first half overall was a solid performance but we didn't pressure their goal keeper at all. They did nothing special except come forward with two good attacks and unfortunately managed to score with each. <br>
									Their first goal came from a good build up, a cross to the center which a forward brought down well and put away without any hesitation. Simple and effective. I think it was their first time far forward with a real attack and we were a bit shocked to concede a goal when we had been otherwise looking comfortable. <br>
									Their second goal later in the half came from a bit of luck in that neither the linesman - suspicion of wearing a green hooped jersey but it was the other side of the pitch - nor the referee saw the ball go out of play at our goal end. From the follow on play they floated in a cross which was again blasted past Jonathon for an undeserved 2 goal lead. Again, we were shocked and complained a bit but Ryuji got everyone focused again and gave us a very good half time talk. Good in that we went out and did exactly what he said to do. <br>
									The main change at half time was to shuffle some players about, especially this Rob up to act as a full-forward. We don't have a natural finisher but using me as a battering-ram forced the Celts to give some space to our wingers and to play deeper than they had in the first half. <br>
									<br>
									Very quickly, some neat play found Alex straight in front of goal with 2 Celts paying very close attention. From a position of kneeling on his left knee he managed to control the ball with his right and send one defender the wrong way before getting back up and gently stroking a left foot shot under<br>
									their keeper. 2-1 and everything to play for. <br>
									We pressured and had them pegged back in their half for long spells but from one counter attack from a corner kick they found themselves facing a charging Jonathon at the far left of our penalty box. It looked like he had succeeded in pushing the attacker far enough towards the end line that the angle was too tight for a shot on goal but the Celt pulled off a very accurate shot which rolled agonizingly over our goal line. Against the prevailing run of play but this time even the Celts thought it a bit of luck for the Irish. <br>
									Soon after Jonathon made a brilliant save to deny them the game with 20 minutes to go and keep us in it. <br>
									We really got back in the game when their defender bundled Zander over in their box when the ball was likely going safely out of play anyway. The referee had no doubt and Ryuji slammed home the penalty despite their keep getting a hand to it. 3-2 and we were the only team that was going to score from then on. <br>
									I think as full forward for the second half I don't remember touching the ball more than a handful of times but their defense certainly gave me a lot of attention. Amos especially enjoyed the additional room down the wings and from one great run his shot was tipped on to the cross bar by the Celt keeper, it fell towards me in the scramble, on the bounce at chest height and 2 meters out from goal. <br>
									Lets just say the ball was actually found again but miles away from the Celtic net. The half volley went a bit over the bar and kept going in a mostly upward trajectory. Scoring looked easier and all I can say was it came high and I sent it higher. Various comments on rugby and Gaelic football were most amusing and highly original. Think sarcasm at this point.  We plugged away at them and were finishing strong like last week.<br>
									Unfortunately we could not find their net and finished regretting a 1st half performance that was much poorer than our second half. <br>
									Lets bring that early next week and get our first win. We deserve it. <br>
