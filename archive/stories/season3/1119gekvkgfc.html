								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sat 19th November.</b> The Welsh connection secured the Geckoes 3 points against KGFC at YCAC with a solid victory on a beautiful late autumn day.<br>
									<br>
									This was the first encounter between the Geckoes and KGFC and the Geckoes were expected to be tested by KGFC&rsquo;s intricate passing game.   KGFC were not discouraged by the fact that they were a man short and battled hard all game.<br>
									<br>
									The Geckoes took the lead in the opening exchanges with a wonder volley from central midfielder Peter Exton from 30 yards into the top corner.  The goal gave the Geckoes confidence and they threatened to add to their tally, Robert Hughes going very close with a good turn and shot just going the wrong side of the post.  KGFC managed to have a good amount of possession and had a few half chances but they were frequently caught offside by the Geckoes back 4.  <br>
									<br>
									The Geckoes had more possession in the second half and stretched the KGFC defence by using the flanks well.  The Geckoes always looked like scoring a second and it finally came thanks to an excellent pinpoint cross from Peter Zollar for Robert Hughes to clinically head home from 6 yards out.  It was an excellent all round team performance by the Geckoes and they will be looking to build on this next week against the Swiss.  Finally, thanks to referee Quentin O&rsquo;Mahoney who controlled the game excellently from start to finish.<br>
