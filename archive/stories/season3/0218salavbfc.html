								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sat 18th February.</b> Advocators of football as art suffered a heavy moral defeat on Saturday, as Sala edged a tense encounter in Saitama. BFC just couldn&rsquo;t find a way past an obstinate Sala back line, and so an early second half goal against the run of play, helped Sala to a first win over the British since the last game of last season.<br>
										BFC dominated territorially and in terms of possession, but Sala played to their strengths and probably put in more effort man for man. You can always tell a one sided game, when you hear someone telling their opponent that their team &ldquo;dominated the first five minutes&rdquo; in defence of the scoreline.<br>
										Sala certainly started more brightly, a long cross-field pass from Brookey sent Charles clear, but his chip ended up nestled on the top of the net.<br>
										Sala created little in the way of chances for the rest of the half, Lenny shooting over when well placed, and Jason forcing a save from the BFC keeper after another good pass from Brookey. Apart from that it was all BFC. They racked up corner after corner; as well as numerous throw ins and free kicks around the box.<br>
										Jon Day did well to turn Clarkey in the box, but he shot straight at Sid from a few yards out. BFC then had a stonewall penalty turned down, when Brookey handled in the box. Since Sala tend to handle in the box once or twice a game as a rule, with the result invariably being a penalty, the fact that this wasn&rsquo;t given was an ominous sign for BFC. It wasn&rsquo;t to be their day.<br>
										In the second half Shigeru made his long awaited return to the fore and was immediately involved, driving the midfield forward and causing all kinds of trouble with his ability to fend off several players at once.<br>
										Sala went ahead 10 minutes in, when Andres squared Shigeru&rsquo;s through ball to Dhugal. He took a touch, but as the ball squirmed away from him, there was a collision between keeper, defender and striker. It would have been a penalty, but the referee sagely allowed the advantage, and Charles slotted home from a tight angle. 1v0.<br>
										In between long periods of BFC pressure, Sala did create a few chances in the second half, Dhugal megging his marker before being blocked by the keeper, Shigeru shooting wide and then over from mid-range. But it was at the back that the battle was won, with determination, skill, and luck all playing a part in keeping the score sheet blank. Sid, evidently feeling a bit Mick Dundee, took time to go on several walkabouts, but survived them all with the help of some last ditch defending. Although an after game comment that Brookey had come closer to catching the ball than Sid during the game, is perhaps a little cruel, Brooke-Smith certainly didn&rsquo;t seem happy with just one moment of controversy,<br>
										Another failed handball shout against him in the box, saw the last fight go out of BFC, as they became demoralised by the referees apparent pragmatism.<br>
										Sala were given the chance to really rub it in in the dying minutes when Dhugal&rsquo;s clever pass sent Charles clean through. His chip beat the keeper, but drifted agonisingly wide of the left hand post, prompting some Mediterranean theatrics from the Sala forward.<br>
										Luckily, it was not to come back and haunt him, but Sala once again showed that they need to be a little more ruthless in front of goal if they are to capitalise on the bravery of their defending.<br>
										The match ended with BFC entrenched in the Sala half, stacking up goal line scrammy after goal line scrammy, but the back four held firm and took a welcome three points back to Chiba.<br>
										There were no fans and indeed few seats at the Hachioji ground in Yono last Saturday, but rest assured, if there had been, edges would have been perched on.<br>
										Once again though, despite all the hyperbole (not a word commonly associated with TML football), Sala captured the points, and at the end of the season, that will be all that matters.<br>
