								<p><b>Hachijoji Sunday 25th September.</b> The Saitama Jets and the Vagabonds both had to settle for a 2-2 draw at Hachioji Park in a game where the balance shifted several times.<br>
									<br>
									The Jets, fresh off the back of two good league victories, got off to a dream start. Gary Garner threaded a delicate ball through to forward Ryan Loren, who shrugged off the defender before rounding the keeper and slotting home after about 5 minutes. The Jets made several chances to add to the goal, but Tomo Kobayashi and Nate Gildart, in particular, failed to beat the impressive Vags goalie. As the half wore on, the Vags started to dictate play a bit more, and looked capable of scoring. When the Jets gave the ball away cheaply in midfield, a cross was swung over from the right, and the Vags midfielder whacked a fine volley past Harada in the Jets goal. 1-1 at half-time.<br>
									<br>
									The second half continued with much of the same, with the Jets pressing, but the Vags looking capable on the break and from set-pieces. When Kazu made another, er, ...'inconsistent' decision, hot-headed Frenchman Olivier Hembise blew his top and accused the ref of taking a bribe. Kazu duly showed him how red his card was, leaving the Jets with only 10 men for the last 20 minutes or so. The Vags pushed forward, and another long ball saw Bill meet it before keeper Fraser Gould, and guide it into the empty net.<br>
									2-1 to the Vags, and an upset looked on the cards.<br>
									<br>
									The Jets threw men forward, and Romford Rob again probed for gaps in the Vagabonds defence. Mikey Passmore had a fine chance, only to scuff his shot wide, Captain Marvellous Mark Eite hit the bar with a freekick, and the Vags keeper tipped a goal-bound effort from Garner over. With a minute or two remaining, a cross caused mayhem in the Vags box and a defender handled it. Garner stepped up, and slotted it home, cool as a cucumber. It was his second goal of the season, both from set-plays, and it salvaged a point for the Jets from a game they may regret not winning.<br>
