								<p><b>OiFuto, Friday 5th May.</b> The packed crowd of 28 there to witness the TML inauguration of the excellent new long blade astro field at Oi Futo No. 2. were treated to a pulsating fixture that featured end to end action of exciting, intense football of high quality.&nbsp; In previous seasons the Hibs and YCAC&nbsp; had a reputation for being bruising small pitch specialists; but this season they have developed into the 2 most entertaining teams in the TML; eschewing the long ball game and building attacks from the back and able to hold possession for long periods. With the league decided this was crucial to YCAC&rsquo;s chance to clinch 2nd place and for both teams to claim boasting rights.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									The match began with the Hibs dominating the early exchanges and we were unlucky not to go 1-0 up after 2 minutes when Kuni K beat the off side trap and was one on one with the keeper; lifting the ball over him, only for the Hibs faithful to watch it drift a metre wide. The first half continued along similar lines with the previously impenetrable YCAC defense looking about as safe as a Russian submarine. The Hibs&nbsp;pacey wide men were on form, Yohei Ohta doing his Christiano Ronaldo impersonations that has bamboozled many wide defenders this year. The Hibs strikers were taking their&nbsp;turn at one on one chances with the YCAC keeper. One such chance saw Mick O&rsquo;Hagan beat the offside trap and meet a bouncing through ball 25 yards out. The YCAC keeper advanced to challenge and&nbsp;Mick lobbed it over the keeper&rsquo;s head. It looked to be headed goalward but the outstretched hand of the keeper stopped it at the last moment. The extra American football lines confused both the keeper and the referee; as the keeper was standing 5 yards outside of his box when he palmed the ball. &quot;Never mind&quot; thought the ref it would be a pity to spoil such a good save even though the keeper was lying outside the D after the save. Mick finally got the first goal after a nice turn from Tomo began a move that finished with Yasu cutting the ball across the goal the Mick swept in. Mick hit the bar 5 minutes later with an open goal to aim for and a quickly taken free kick was well saved by the YCAC keeper but the rebound was put wide from 5 yards. Hitoshi was a spectator for the first half, but we only went in 1-0 ahead, with the YCAC encouraged that they weren&rsquo;t down by 4 or 5.<br>
									&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Into the second half and the YCAC must have had some smelling salts or something stronger at the interval as they came out a much more lively outfit. Scheduling and grounds problems had left the Hibs without a league game in&nbsp;over a month and&nbsp;we tired on the big pitch in the second half. The YCAC&rsquo;s ex-pro Daisuke was inspired up front throughout the second half; holding off defenders, running strongly and creating chances for others. The YCAC central midfielders were up to their usual tricks: Antony Savage directing the ball laterally at every opportunity and Joe Takeda infuriating several Hibs-men. It was that man JT who picked up a misdirected Hibs pass and quickly played in a pin point ball behind the Hibs defense that Daisuke put a glancing header beyond Hitoshi to level the scores. The Hibs were momentarily stung back to life, and we missed another couple of one on ones and had a goal bound shot from some corner scraps cleared off the line. &nbsp;The YCAC though were not to be outdone and Hitoshi was called into action a few times, on one occasion throwing himself at the feet of Gavin for a fine save. The final say came as the YCAC disposed a Hibs player in a dangerous position and rolled it through for Gavin who finished bravely past the on coming Hitoshi. By this stage the Hibs had run out of gas and the match finished at 2-1.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									At the end of the day football is about putting the ball in the back of the net and the YCAC were able to do it more effectively than the Hibs on this occasion. The Hibs are already looking forward to a rematch next season.<br>
