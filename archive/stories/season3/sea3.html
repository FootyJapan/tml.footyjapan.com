						The evening kicked off with a sumptuous BBQ that many chose to wash down with one or two Vodka-Redbulls, followed by a J&auml;germeister or four, served by rubber-clad gals who claimed to be the official 'J&auml;germeister Girls', but those who had actually been to a J&auml;germeister sponsored event in the past, had their suspicions - perhaps it was the foreheads full of acne that initially roused suspicion. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0701eosparty.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<p><b>Oi Futo1, Saturday 17th June.</b> YCAC vs WS Geckoes wrapped up TML 3 at Oi Futo on Saturday morning; YCAC running out comfortable&nbsp;winners. Though a poor run for YCAC in April had spoiled the organizers hopes of a last day title decider with the Hibs, there was still plenty at stake almost up until the last kick of the season.<br>

The goals came from Keating, and, predictably, Loren, Gildart and Garner. There were other chances to add to the lead, but in rotten conditions, the Jets hot-shots were unable to take advantage.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						Both&nbsp;teams entered the game with something to prove. Shane had a reputation for a mean defence, with only 8 goals conceded in 12 games. They had also held the Celts and Stoneds to draws in recent weeks, confirming that they are one of the strongest sides in the division. The Jets were champions-elect, and had the best goal-scoring record in Division Two with 41 goals from 12 games. In a battle between defence and attack, it was the penetrating thrust of the Jets which won out. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0611jetsvshane.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 27th May.</b> Despite what the conspiracy theorists may hypothesise it is pace, skill and agility that has seen the Hibs have the wood of Sala in recent years. The Hibs front 2, wide midfielders and attacking midfielders are not afraid to pour forward in numbers and Sala&rsquo;s big men at the back seem to have trouble keeping up. The same big men are so effective against the larger more bullocking style forwards. The Hibs 2005/6 style of attacking football has seen us average just under 4 goals a game and has been great fun to be involved with. Most teams in the league will have seen the Hibs &lsquo;click&rsquo; and score 4 or 5 goals in a 10 - 20 minute period when we are very difficult to defend against. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0527hibsvsala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Shogun Knights (nee Nova FC) have had quite a time of it of late, losing 8-1 to a merciless BFC and only narrowly losing to champions Hibs. Their squad features a couple of ex-Sala henchmen and games between the two generally lack the bite of certain other fixtures on the TML calendar. Sala were not in the mood to totally extend the hand of friendship however. Olive branches left in the locker room, Sala took to the field with a very unusual line up, knowing that the Swiss are still there to be overhauled, should they slip up. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0507salavknights.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The Jets form has been somewhat sporadic in recent weeks, and the fluid attacking play of earlier in the season has been missing. However poorly the team has played, with Gildart and Loren around, goals are always likely. So, lining up for the first time this season with neither of our main goalscorers was a concern. Playing with the wind in the first half, the Jets tended to overhit balls through to Mike Passmore and Mark Eite, and despite having a lot of the ball, we were struggling to create clear chances. The Clash were tidy in midfield, and generally making a better job of playing into the wind than the Jets were of playing with the supposed advantage.<a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0402jetsvclash.html">more ...</a><br>

The 57 Old Farts that run the League, for readers that recall Will Carling, might want to wake up to the obvious fact that todays Ref needs to be 6'4&quot; 17 1/2&nbsp;stone and&nbsp;conversant with&nbsp;modern man management techniques in dealing with player histrionics. &quot;You're going to need to have this whistle surgically removed if you don't shut the f*** &quot; is the blindingly obvious way to deal with someone whos in your face with &quot;Excuse me for asking but how long to go, Ref?&quot; <a class="txlink" href="1015ycacvfrance.html">more...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Hibs Take French from the Derri&egrave;re</h1>
					<p><b>Big Circus Saturday 8th October.</b> Another good game, very similar to the BFC v France game. France took an early lead against a very strong wind with a cracking shot from Julien Sepheriades that swerved and dipped over the keeper. France&nbsp;then&nbsp;looked fairly comfortable for the rest of the first half and all&nbsp; set for a half-time lead with&nbsp;the wind behind them in the second half. But&nbsp;Hibs sneaked one just before half time.<br>
						The wind was not as strong in the second half and neither side dominated, but Josh Shirmer&nbsp;scored a screamer from well outside the area after 15 min, then Keita Narama found himself one on one with the keeper with 5 minutes to go as France left a few gaps at the back pressing forward&nbsp;for the equaliser. <a class="txlink" href="1008hibsvfrance.html">more..</a>.<br>

						Later in the day, BEFC started their return to Div 2 football with a fortunate 1-0 victory over WallStreet Clash. The Embassy held onto the lead after one of the Clash players shinned a clearance into his own net after only 15 minutes. Both sides came close in the 2nd half but it was to be the only goal of the game.<br>

					<p><b>Misato Sunday 2nd October.</b> The French squad was on the turf on a bright and hot day in Misato facing off against the newly promoted KGFC. The first half saw a good Japanese opposition taking charge of the play. Very active on both wings, indeed it was from the left that the danger came - Ally parried the ball nicely, only for a KGFC player to recover the ball and stroke a nice shot home from 10-meters. 0-1 &#150;Time for a break and a drink. We had the second half to get back in the game and show our true colours, which we did. A much more active and efficient French squad created some threatening chances. Aziz got the ball after a very nice pass and after a dribble, he beat the keeper from close range to score his debut goal for the French. 1-1. After a poor clearance from the KGFC defense, Taka received the ball and put it straight back in le mixeur (the mixer) the rebound caught the keeper by surprise and the French went 1-ahead. KGFC did thrust forward towards the end of the game, however the French squad held on to their lead with some fine saves by Ally and good all round work from Man of the Match &#150; Taka. We did not play our best football on that hot day, but the result is what matters and we got an important second win to stay afloat in the league race.<br>

					<p><b>Hachijoji Sunday 25th September.</b> Wall Street Geckoes claimed their first three points of the season with a convincing win over newly promoted (and newly named) Shogun Knights. Gino Dilberto opened the scoring with a powerful header on the 15th minute and WSG never looked like giving up the lead after that. A lovely finish from Kazu Kikuchi after some patient build up play saw the Geckoes going into the interval 2-0 up. Soon after the break new midfielder Peter Exton opened his account for the team with a neatly taken goal and Phil Stroud ensured that the Geckoes would take all 3 points with a good finish.<br>
						SK stuck to the task at hand and were rewarded with a scrappy, but deserved goal late on in the 2nd period from David Hales. Quentin, the ref, had a very good match, and his sensible decision making kept the game flowing and prevented any fare ups that have previously marred this fixture.<br>

					<p><b>Monday 19th September, OiFuto</b>. Newcomers Stoneds FC held Maritizio to a 1 all draw in their first TML outing.<br>
						<br>
						Maritizio were the first to strike, as a corner was met by a fierce, near post volley, giving the keeper no chance. The lead only lasted a few minutes though as mid-way through the first half, the Maritizio keeper was caught out of position and could only parry a Stoneds half volley into the inside of the side netting. 1-1<br>
						<br>
						The 2nd half had more action than the first and both keepers were forced into action on numerous occasions. Hidenori Yoshioka, Stoneds midfield playmaker, showed he will be a handful for Div 2 defences as he made countless chances but there were to be no more goals.<br>

					<h1 class="navy">BFC Display New Found Resolve</h1>
					<p><b>September 12th Big Circus, Hon Atsugi.</b> Partly due to new summer signings and partly due to that great British resolve, BFC scored two second-half goals to defeat an energetic France FC team who themselves managed to score one goal with the very last kick of the game. Fluid play, combined with a new-look hardened midfield and back-four, with the welcome inclusion of the ever-industrious James Morson and hard-man Leigh Manson, saw the BFC break the French defensive line time and time again in the first half, with some dangerous runs from the BFC front men, who seemed to have found and extra yard of pace over the summer. However, some stout defending by the French kept the score equal at half-time. 15-minutes into the second half and it was a text book header from former Shanghai Shooter Jon Best, following a pin-perfect cross, that sent BFC into the lead. Mid-way through the second half France FC became ever-more industrious stringing together some good passes, but failing to hold the ball up in attack, or hit the target. BFC striker Jon Day increased the lead for BFC, with 20 minutes still on the clock, when the ball broke free from a throng of players and he volleyed home from the edge of the 6-yard box. In the final 10-minutes the French surged forward looking for a break and a sweetly struck shot just inside the area forced a miraculous save from new BFC keeper Jyurki ....... France FC finally found the back of the net when BFC failed to clear their lines following a corner and the quick-witted France FC striker slotted home from a tight angle, but the final score line saved the blushes of the BFC defense. All in a great game played in fantastic &quot;TML spirit&quot; - hard but fair. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.bfctokyo.com" target="_blank">click here</a>.<br>

					<p>New signing Tomomitsu Kuni (of ex-BFC fame) scored the opening two goals for Tokyo Hibernian FC and set-up the third, in the space of 12-minutes, in a drumming of newly promoted Shogun Nights FC (formerly Nova FC) who received a rude awakening to 1st division football with a 6-1 loss in their opening match. Hibs throughout turned defense into attack with some precision football and their movement off the ball and all-round route-one football suggests that they are gunning for for the top-spot having been pipped at the post by the Swiss last season. Shogun Nights FC, to their credit, looked dangerous in the last third of the pitch, with both strikers not afraid to unleash and keep renowned shot-stopper Hitoshi Ono on his toes. However, Shogun Nights FC failed to consistently hold on to the ball in midfield and for the best part were chasing Hibs shadows around the park, especially in the first half when they conceded 5. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('0912hibsvknights.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">click here</a>.<br>

					<p><b>September 4th OiFuto Dai Ni.</b> There is an old saying in Japanese, which states roughly that if everyone accepted apologies, there would be no need for the police. Sala midfielder Stephen Brooke-Smith came to understand this sentiment on Sunday. Upon rather churlishly flicking the ball away after the whistle was blown for a Jetro free kick, he found his apologies falling on deaf ears. Kazu, the man in black, reached for the yellow card and after only 4 minutes it was quite clear, TML Season 3 was well and truly underway. <a class="txlink" href="javascript:popwindow('0904salavjetro.html','top=150,left=50,width=520,height=550,buttons=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,resizable=yes,status=no,directories=no,toolbar=no')">more..</a>.<br>

					<p><b>September 4th OiFuto Dai Ni.</b> A goal early in the 1st half was enough to secure victory for BFC against a determined Wallstreet Geckoes team who are looking to rise from mediocrity this season. A new-look BFC team looked strong at the back and dangerous on the break, however Geckoes defended resolutely and will feel that had they finished their early chances the 3-points would've been theirs. Geckoes will refuse to be rolled-over by any of the big teams in the 1st division and this gritty, tenacious and industrious team may even cause one or two upsets as the season progresses.
