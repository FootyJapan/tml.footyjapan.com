								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sat 19th November.</b> The unbeaten Saitama Jets survived a second-half comeback to register a 5-2 victory against the British Embassy, their 3rd successive victory against the men in red.<br>
									<br>
									The Jets started well against the 10-man strong Embassy, attacking with the verve and pace that have helped them rise to the top of Division 2.&nbsp; Gildart and Loren were looking sharp, and Sasaki, Keating and Garner were pulling the strings in midfield. The first goal came after Rob Keating's shot was blocked by the keeper, and the hungry Ryan Loren followed up the rebound. A second for the Jets, and Loren, followed shortly after, as he latched onto Sasaki's cross from the left and finished with aplomb. After a couple of half-chances, a scramble in the box saw defender Masato Takahashi smack the ball off the post, and Nate Gildart was in the perfect position to slot home the rebound. The Embassy had started the game with only 10 men, so their first-half threat came mostly from set-pieces and fast breaks, usually involving the skillful number 12. Despite the absence of a number of first-choice defenders, the Jets back line held firm, with striker Mark Eite marshaling the back four, and Takahashi and Yasu Suyama scrapping well. Just before half-time, the Jets thought they had added a fourth when Sasaki controlled a cross from the right and volleyed home, but the linesman's offside flag ruled the 'goal' out.<br>
									<br>
									3-0 up at half-time, and the Jets were coasting. Even when the late Embassy players arrived and brought them up to full strength, the Jets continued to pile on the pressure. The Saitama men won a series of free-kicks outside the box, all of which midfielder Garner succeeded in wasting. When Sasaki rolled the ball back to him 30 yards out, though, he made no mistake and whacked the ball in off the underside of the crossbar. It was at this point, at 4-0 down, that the Embassy revival began. First, a swift move down the left-hand side was finished smartly to make it 4-1. Then, from a long ball, the Embassy midfielder got a flick-on, and the big guy up front, who had been struggling with a muscle injury, controlled well with his chest before volleying past the Jets keeper. A little panic then set in for the Jets, as the Embassy looked to claw their way back into the game. The Saitama  men continued to attack, however, and only the final ball and shot were missing to round off a number of incisive moves. The fifth goal was fairly simple, as Garner got away from his marker to thump a header into the top left corner from Kobayashi's inviting corner.<br>
									<br>
									It finished 5-2, a result which leaves the Embassy struggling in the lower half of Division Two, while the Jets remain top of the table.<br>

									<b>Man of the Match: Mark Eite. The club's all-time leading scorer showed he can defend as well.<br>
