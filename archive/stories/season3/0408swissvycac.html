								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sat 8th April.</b> Nice day for a game, unfortunately it was at YCAC which is getting bumpier by the day but I guess we have to be grateful for any pitch we can get.&nbsp; <br>
									About the match, it really wasn&rsquo;t much of one to tell the truth.&nbsp; There was a lot of huffing and screaming at the referee from both sides and very little skill on display as a result of the poor conditions.&nbsp; The best looking player from a skill stand point was the YCAC right midfielder and he sent Krando sliding a couple of times but never created much danger as he didn&rsquo;t want to come off the grass on the side and his crosses were headed out by Cho or Kirk.&nbsp;<br>
									 YCAC had one chance about 20 minutes in when Damien floated in a perfect cross for James to knock in but he pushed it just wide.&nbsp; Another chance for the YCAC was hit straight at Peter and he did well to knock it out for a corner.&nbsp; The Swiss didn&rsquo;t create much up front &#150; the forwards just being muscled off the ball meant that they couldn&rsquo;t create anything or get a clear shot.&nbsp; <br>
									<br>
									The only real chance came from a free kick around 25 meters out.&nbsp; Aoki drove in a bending ball over the defense, Krando ran through the wall and rather than knock it on chose to let in run in leaving the keeper stranded.&nbsp; The offside flag went up and a consultation resulted but a good goal stood.&nbsp; <br>
									Since I was the player in the offside position, at the far post with a perfect view of Krando&rsquo;s run, the call was correct in spite of the hoots and howls from the YCAC team.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
									 Other than that, a lot of high balls &#150; and head balls and very little passing because it is near impossible to do it were the lowlights of the 1H and most of the 2H for that matter.&nbsp; YCAC brought on some skillful Japanese players, including Daisuke up front, it created a little more havoc in the Swiss half.&nbsp; In spite of that the Swiss were able to get through for 2 one on one&rsquo;s vs. the keeper &#150; typical of our year though &#150; unable to finish them off.&nbsp; <br>
									YCAC had 2 decent chances with James shooting just wide of the right post and with a Daisuke header to the far post rolling away for a goal kick.&nbsp; The YCAC worked hard for the equalizer but it just wasn&rsquo;t to be on a windy and bumpy day.&nbsp; It was a good warm up for next week&rsquo;s Cup semi-final in Saitama and I think both teams will have different members and mind sets for that match.&nbsp; The Swiss have climbed back into second in the league but the YCAC have a game in hand so still all to play for as Sala are close behind as well.<br>
