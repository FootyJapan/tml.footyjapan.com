								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 11th December.</b> This was a game of contrasting styles, both sartorial and footballing. If Eminem and Da Pump formed a football team, it would be Maritizio. However, their baggy long pants and cute line in knitted bobble caps flatters to deceive - these boys can play a bit. As for Clash, they thought it couldn't get worse than having a fixture the day after the Bonenkai - until Ken turned up with the kit. He had been told to wash it, but apparently, no one thought to tell him you need to dry it, too. Damp, cold and hungover, Clash squidged onto the Hachioji turf to do battle.<br>
									<br>
									The pattern of play was set when the two teams eyeballed each other at the line-up before kick-off. With Ian, Pinglar, Andy, Rob, Sid and Elliot all towering over this diminutive Maritizio side, you could sense that Clash were going to go for aerial and physical dominance, while Maritizio would be best served by keeping the ball on the ground. And that is just what they did, to great effect. The men in maroon moved the ball around sharply and confidently, often seeming to have an extra man in space. Maritizio constantly drew the Clash out so they could play a through ball into the channels for their pacey forwards to run onto. It may to have been the only weapon in their arsenal, but it was an effective one, which they used to carve a few half-chances in the first half. Not that they were having it all their own way; Clash have made harrying opponents in midfield a key feature of their play this season, with Ken in particular grafting hard and creating chances for the forwards. Sid, Daylan and Rob found space to shoot from the edge of the box on several occasions, though the keeper was never tested. Masa, Ken, Chris, Daylan and Besty kept working down the right-hand side, and as the first-half drew to a close it looked like Clash were shading it on possession and chances created. <br>
									However, the half still had a goal to offer, and it was Maritizio who opened the scoring. A counter attack saw the ball fed to number 15 on the halfway line, who showed excellent quick feet to take it past Ian. He then bore in on goal and hit his shot early from the corner of the box. Elliot got two hands on the ball, but it somehow eluded his grasp and trickled into the net. The keeper felt bad enough about it to call it an o.g., but reprieved himself with his excellent reading of the game, clearing from outside the box on a number of subsequent occasions.<br>
									<br>
									Clash were determined that their game plan was right and all that was required to produce results in the second half was time. About two-and-a-half minutes of time, as it turned out. The Maritizio defence were caught taking too many touches on their own 18-yard line, the ball broke off Alec to Rob on the edge of the box, and he took one touch and fired an unstoppable shot into the left corner of the net. Game on, and both teams reverted to their original game plans. Elliot played as a virtual sweeper at times which thwarted the Maritizio through ball, while Maritizio countered the physical Clash midfield with a few meaty challenges of their own. The red mist only descended once or twice, with Matt Best of old making a nostalgic (and hopefully farewell!) appearance with a vintage scything hack. On the whole, the angry wee girlies on both sides only ranted and raved once or twice and sportsmanship prevailed.<br>
									<br>As tiredness set in the last ten minutes became a bit ragged. Clash's Chris was getting frustrated with his team's failure to hold onto the ball, and for the second night in a row spewed forth some verbal obscenity. Rob had a chance to clinch a winner but his glancing header was a shade too precious and drifted past. A 1-1 finish, probably a fair result, but one that does neither team favours in terms of league position. Clash congratulate themselves on a four-game unbeaten run, but ominously the bulk of their remaining fixtures are against higher-placed clubs.<br>
									Sterner tests await.&nbsp;<br>
