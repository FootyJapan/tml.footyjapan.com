								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sun 15th January.</b> Drew&rsquo;s last minute solo effort secured a 2-2 draw and a point for tie specialists the Wall Street Clash, in an enjoyable game in which they came back from behind twice and in which 3 goals were scored in the last 5 minutes.  <br>
									<br>
									Seconds previously Barbarians had scored from a corner to take the lead for the second time, and 5 minutes before that the Clash&rsquo;s Raph had dribbled the length of the pitch and rounded the goalkeeper to cancel out the Barbarians first half penalty.<br>
									<br>
									Wall Street had most certainly started the game the livelier of the two teams.  A combination of Ian, Pingler and Masa in defence getting the ball hoofed up field quickly, and Drew and Spencer wrestling possession from the Barbarians midfield, supplied ammunition for a number of incursions into the Barbarians penalty area by Andy and Sid. <br>
									<br>
									It soon became apparent that Barbarians too had a silver haired 40-something who kept himself in good nick in Hideki, whose speed and skill, aligned with the strong tackling of the other members of a very decent Barbarians midfield gradually pushed the balance of the game in their favour.  <br>
									<br>
									In the middle of the first half a desperate lunge across a Barbarian with only the keeper to beat resulted in a penalty which was dispatched low and to the right.<br>
									<br>
									The half time team-talk in the Clash&rsquo;s dressing room centred on getting the ball down and playing a bit of football.  After following this tack for most of the second half with no success at all, Raph started his sprint from the half-way line, Andy thumped the ball into his path over a hopelessly static Barbarians back line, and the rest was history. <br>
									<br>
									The Barbarians could be forgiven for feeling depressed after this game &#150; they thought they had scored the winner with one minute remaining, this time from a corner, only for Drew, after a bit of pinball in midfield following kick off, to run with the ball to the right of the Barbarians penalty box and beat the keeper from a tight angle with a low hard drive.<br>
