								<p><b>Hachioji Park Sat 12th November.</b> Following their first defeat of the season by top of the table Saitama Jets, Barbarians were looking to quickly get back on winning form and returned to the same ground a week later to take on AFC<br>
									<br>
									The Barbarians squad was similar to the previous week although was missing &quot;playmaker&quot; John Stokes out on International Duty. Barbs squad consisted of Kaz in goal, Fred &amp; Fergs in central defence with Hideki &amp; Steve making up the back four. Starting midfield was Richard, Rouven, Jaffa &amp; Muramoto with Danny &amp; Mark up front. On the bench was Johnny Mac, Jimmy &amp; Leon<br>
									<br>
									The game kicked off with both sides looking to attack at every opportunity. First chances fell to AFC but the disciplined BaBa defence kept things under control in the opening quarter. Barbs had a few chances of their own and earned a couple of corners but it took 20 minutes for a breakthrough. A neat ball thru to Rouven in a similar position to the one he scored from last week saw him thru on goal. A similarly well taken finish saw BaBas one up again. AFC pushed hard for an equaliser and had a chance soon after to level the scores, some unusually poor BaBa defending opened up a gaping hole but the shot was off target and BaBas had a lucky escape. Moments later a good save from Kaz protected BaBas lead. Shortly before half time on a well worked counter attack Mark was released clean thru on goal, the clever money was on this clinical finisher to extend BaBas lead, surprisingly Mark put the ball wide of the far post having done most of the hard work. AFC continued to press hard but good back-tracking from the midfield, especially Muramoto &amp; Macaloon helped snuff out most of the danger and the score remained 1-0 up till the break<br>
									<br>
									The 2nd half started off much the same as the first with both sides still looking to attack at every opportunity. Chances appeared at either end, both sides felt frustrated by some doubtful offside calls, BaBa probably the more aggrieved as they had managed to bundle the ball in the net on one of these occassions. Early in the second half some great individual play from AFC's diminutive Taichi saw him dance thru three tackles and slice open the BaBas defence, expecting the cut back from the goal line into the box Kaz was probably most surprised to see the ball curled past him, sneaking in at the far post from the acutest of angles for the equalising goal.<br>
									<br>
									Barbs dissapointed at squandering the lead came out firing on all cylinders and mounted two or three attacks which were broken down by a disciplined AFC defence. One such attack looked to be over when the ball came out to Jaffa well outside the penalty area. A tremendous shot from distance thundered in off the post restoring BaBas lead. AFC pushed forward and looked threatening, no 11 creating a couple of chances that could have produced more. Once again BaBas were given a let off when AFC blasted wide after some great play had opened up the defence and got Kaz out of position. Minutes later AFC broke thru the offside trap and homed in on goal, Kaz coming off his line quickly made a point blank save to keep BaBas in the lead. BaBas were defending hard now but always looking for the counter attack opportunity. One fell to Hideki who found himself in the unusual position of lone striker during the last 10 minutes of the game, picking up the ball in his own half he sped forward losing his marker, a shot looked likely as he came in on goal but he decided to go round the keeper at pace, unfortunately too much pace, leaving him too tight an angle to finish off the chance and the game. Final score Barbarians 2, AFC 1<br>
