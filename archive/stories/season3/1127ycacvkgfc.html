								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sun 27th November.</b> A goal apiece from free scoring defenders Damian Hart and Daisuke Ogawa was enough to see off a plucky and skillfull KGFC side&nbsp; at YCAC on Sunday<br>
									<br>
									Pre match rumours that sibling rivalry between the Takeda brothers had prompted Tim to stuff his KGFC side full of ex pros proved a little wide of the mark. Rather it was YCACs Joe that won family bragging rights after a MOM performance in midfield.<br>
									<br>
									KGFC fought gamely from start to finish and played well enough to give YCAC problems all over the pitch except the key one, the last 1/3. Hello Tony. Keeper Gary Hodgson had barely a shot to save though did earn his money dealing comfortably with corners and free kicks. YCAC had the visitors on the ropes for much of the game but missed chance after chance to inflict a heavier defeat. A barrage of shots rarely managed to even test the Goalie, a cardinal sin considering KGFC were forced to play outfield players between the sticks all afternoon.<br>
									<br>
									Despite all the pressure, Damos trusty left boot and a bicycle kick from Daisuke provided all the goals YCAC would get and they ran out convincing 2-0 winners<br>
