								<p><b>St Mary's, Sat 14th January.</b> On a brutally cold day, where it rained heavily from the start to the finish, the Hibs&rsquo; critics were asking the question &#150; can this &ldquo;pretty boy 10-0 winning&rdquo; team get down and dirty and grind out a result on a nasty day like this. The answer was yes indeed we could.<br>
									<br>
									The Hibs were vying for the fastest goal ever in the TML as Keita kicked off directly to Yasu out wide who hit the bye line and cut back for Yama to smash in after 5.43 seconds. We then continued to press on the KGFC goal and Yama headed in a corner that the keeper parried, but it bounced about 30 cm over the line over the line but a controversial decision from the one eyed KGFC linesman saw play waved on, Kazu unsighted had to take the linesman&rsquo;s word. KGFC continued to use the home linesman to advantage as they played the offside trap and the linesman was flagging more than an Aussie rules goal umpire officiating another Sydney Swans high scoring victory. <br>
									<br>
									KGFC got level as a Josh no-look skidding back-pass went to the side of Hitoshi for an own goal from 20 metres. Not as spectacular as Josh&rsquo;s 2 x 30 yard screamers against France FC but he still finished clinically. Yama made it 2-1 shortly before half time as an error from the last KGFC defender saw him one on one with the KGFC keeper and he thumped it past him. 2 -1 into half time. <br>
									<br>
									In the second half there was no score for most of the half before Keita received the ball back post and performed a trademark turn from close range and thumped one over the keeper to the back post to make it 3-1. Five minutes from the end and a KGFC handball in the box saw the Hibs awarded a penalty. Considering Yama had a clear goal disallowed that would made it 3 for the day for him; he was given the chance to complete his hatrick. His first effort was saved but KGFC encroachment gave him the chance to take it again and he thumped it into the roof of the net to make it a well deserved hattrick for Mr. Yamaguchi and 4 for the Hibs.<br>
									<br>
									The Hibs have opened a gap on the opposition at the top of the table but there is still a lot of work to do before claiming their 2nd TML 1st division title. An interesting match that the Hibs are looking forward to is scheduled for Sunday the 22nd Vs the Swiss.<br>
