								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 22nd October. </b>Wall Street Geckoes came away from Hachioji park with all three points, after a superb team performance over Japanese side JETRO. But by no means was it a one-team affair, as the Geckoes were forced to battle hard for victory against their skillful opponents. In the end though, it was the physically stronger team who would finish victorious.<br>
									<br>
									Starting brightly in the first half, despite the early kick off time, Geckoes took the lead early on through winger Simon Hiscocks. A throw in on the left resulted in a long, high ball into the box, which the JETRO defence had problems in dealing with, as Welsh striker Rob Hughes rose like John Charles to flick the ball into Hiscocks path. The tricky winger completed the move stylishly as he fired into the bottom corner.<br>
									<br>
									The score increased soon afterwards as Geckoes raced into a two goal advantage. Some neat attacking play, with some three Geckoes players involved in the build up, resulted in a Peter Exton volley. Hiscocks was again involved, with some unselfish play on the edge of the JETRO box. He played a neat one-two with midfielder Exton, whose strike took a deflection to give the JETRO keeper no hope.<br>
									<br>
									JETRO weren't about to give up the ghost however, as they had several efforts on goal only to be thwarted by Geckoes' giant American keeper, Charles. Eventually though, their efforts were to rewarded with a much deserved goal. Some fast breaking attacking play saw their striker take full advantage of a mix up in the Wall Street defence to pull a goal back for the team in red.<br>
									<br>
									During the second period, JETRO came more into the game with their skilful number 26 at the heart of their moves. Indeed, coupled with some fantastic running off the ball by nippy forward number 19, the team may have felt hard done by not to draw level at two-two. However, the Geckoes defence held firm with Tony Moore marshalling the line well.<br>
									<br>
									As the second half drew on, Geckoes took control. Player manager Rob was introduced into the foray and immediately made his presence felt with some strong running and a powerful shot, only to be denied by the JETRO number one. A Geckoes corner on the right also found athletic striker Kazu having his stinging header tipped away by the keeper in red.<br>
									<br>
									The third Geckoes goal eventually came from the player manager. The ball bobbled about in the box, before Rob was onto it in an Alan Shearer like manner to make the game safe for the blues at 3-1.<br>
									<br>
									All in all, the game was played in a wonderful spirit, which was reflected in the experienced Italian referee not feeling the need to even warn a player, nevermind book anyone.<br>
