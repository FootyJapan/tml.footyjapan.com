					<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sat 25th March.</b> A solid display by Sala on Saturday left any lingering YCAC title aspirations in tatters.<br>
						A clear blue sky tempered only by the gallons of filth pumped into the atmosphere from nearby factories set both teams in good stead. Sala have still yet to lose to YCAC in the TML and they felt confident enough of taking at least a point back to Chiba.<br>
						Both teams fielded under strength sides, Sala managing to piece together a paltry 12 players for such an important game.<br>
						In the first half, Sala looked the livelier of the two teams. Toby headed at the keeper when well placed and then hit the post with a low drive from 20 yards out. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0325ycacvsala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Todoroki, Sun 26th March.</b> Considering the matches between the Hibs and Sala always contain a fair amount of bite (and spite), Sala have made a habit of doing us favours in their other matches. They handed us the first TML title by beating the Swiss in the final game and their two victories over the YCAC have made things much easier for us this time.<br>
						<br>
						Despite the history of Ireland and England and both Tokyo based clubs having played many lively matches in Tokyo over the past 20 years; contests between the BFC and the Hibs have been played in very good spirit over the last few years and bar a few contested offside decisions; this game was no exception. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0326bfcvhibs.html">more ...</a><br>

						Many of the teams involved in this tournament were simultaneously raising urgently needed funds for UNICEF, to aid their ongoing plight of helping children in need throughout the world.<br>
						<br>
						For many of the players the impetus to play hard and shoot-on-sight came from the fact that some of the event sponsors were pledging generous contributions on a per-goal-scored basis.<br>

					<p><b>Mitsuike Koen, Sun 19th March.</b> Shane FC belied their reputation as the meanest defence in Division Two by conceding three in their encounter with the Dutch Embassy. That was one more than they had hitherto let in all season. Just to show that this was a day in which past precedent would be no guide, Shane, usually shy in front of goal, helped themselves to six goals to keep their faint hopes of a promotion place alive. Yet for all the thrills and spills in front of goal this was no classic. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0319shanevdet.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

With 7 first team squad players already missing through injury and other commitments, three additional call offs on the day&nbsp;was not the perfect preparation for this match.&nbsp;With no&nbsp;expense spared, replacement players were found following a&nbsp;flurry of emails, phone calls, smoke signals, emergency SOS messages from Brian, Jon and Phil, in a move that is widely predicted to ensure a dramatic improvement in&nbsp;NTT Docomo's 2nd quarter results. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0319bfcvfra.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

With the ground situated atop a small mountain in Hon-Atsugi and strong winds blowing the match was reminiscent of those joyful 8am kickoffs as a 9yr old when you&rsquo;d kick a rubber/plastic compound ball in the air to see it sail back over your head.<br>
						Add to these conditions the extremely bouncy nature of the astro turf to the incredibly bouncy nature of the football and there was less of the ball sticking to feet than a lean steak to teflon cookery. Drop some &lsquo;talent&rsquo; from Division Two into the mix and all the ingredients were there for a thoroughly enjoyable display of ping-pong football. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0312clashvdet.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

Credit to both teams for putting on a decent show in&nbsp;difficult conditions. The problems of playing football on a hard and bumpy pitch were compounded by a strong gusting wind. Just to rub it in the 2&nbsp;elements even joined forces occasionally; the wind lifting up the top surface and hurling it spitefully into the players faces. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0312ycacvkgfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						In terms of promotion probably a worse result for Shane, as they now need to win all of their remaining games and hope that the Celts slip up against the Clash in the final game.

Unfortunately the noise that most of them provide is not used to help communicate effectively and today was a prime example of that. The referee at YCAC today had to talk to a few of the Clash players about their colourful language in the presence of children. The quieter side lacked duffers and hardly broke into a sweat as they came out 3-1 winners. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0305clashvsto.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						On Saturday at YCAC, Sala ran the whole gambit of emotions, from indifference to apathy, as KGFC got up to their usual tricks and partially succeeded in riling Sala&rsquo;s not insignificant population of hotheads.<br>
