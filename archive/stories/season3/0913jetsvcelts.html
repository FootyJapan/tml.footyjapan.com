								<P>The Saitama Jets began the third TML season showing a resolve to continue improving, and ultimately win promotion to the TML First Division. The campaign kicked off in Tennozu against the Kanto Celts, who the Jets were fortunate to defeat in a come-from-behind victory last season.<br>
									<br>
									This time,the Jets dominated from the kick-off. Yoshi Osawa scored the Jets first goal with a bullet from what seemed like light years from the goal. It zipped into the top right-hand corner leaving the Kanto keeper on the ground. <br>
									<br>
									Nate Gildart doubled the Jets tally by beating a defender outside the box and smacking a left-footer into the bottom-left corner, with the keeper having no chance. Minutes later Gildart blew the half wide open with a similar shot, this time embarrassing another defender before smashing a left-footer into the bottom-right corner. The keeper was again diving without a hope. Gildart was in on the fourth JETs goal, drawing a penalty after being fouled on a header inside the box. Strangely enough, Gildart was not given the go-ahead to claim hat trick. The PK was easily converted by Yukihiro Sasaki to make the score 4-0 at half-time.<br>
									<br>
									In the second half the Jets used their full squad, making several substitutions. Although the Celts began making some chances, the Jets continued to control the game. Both sides missed chances until the JETs right back couldn't keep pace with a Kanto forward, who slotted home to make it 4-1. The Jets refocused and added a fifth after a foul outside the Celts box. Gary Garner, a talented free-kick taker, casually scored from outside the box. Mark Eite had a few unsuccessful, yet impressive runs at the goal, and Simon Bentz had a couple of strong shots narrowly picked off by the keeper.<br>
									<br>
									Having seen off one of the stronger teams in Division Two, the Jets will go into their upcoming games with confidence..<br>
