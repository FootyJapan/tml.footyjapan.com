								<p>On a pitch far, far away from anywhere and everywhere, AFC Wanderers started their season off in great style with a workman like 1-0 display to see off the BFC Vags. With the pitch being in the middle of nowhere and praying to god that the taxi driver wasn&rsquo;t taking us in the wrong direction.<br>
									<br>
									AFC arrived and with 15 players, a first for AFC, we were in good shape. With the Vags arriving 5 minutes before kick-off and sorting themselves out only before kick-off, the Wanderers felt quietly confident. The Wanderers started off in a 4-4-2 formation with Jackie in goal, Jim, Nishant, Kenji and Sami at the back, Raph, Chris, Ben and Eric in the middle and Olly and Yusuke upfront. <br>
									<br>
									The game kicked-off and it was pretty even for the first 10 minutes with &ldquo;Souness&rdquo; Watabs on the sideline barking orders left, right and centre. The Vags had a half chance 5 minutes in from a corner with the AFC defence in confusion, Sid Lloyd popped up and headed his chance over the bar. With Yusukes pace causing the Vags defence all sorts of problems at the back, the Wanderers began to stamp their authority on the game with some patient passing and constant hassling of their opposition. The Wanderers first chance fell to Olly who from 20 yards hit a half volley straight at the keeper who handled it well.<br>
									<br>
									The defence was well organized and the midfield, Eric in particular, stopped everything that came their way and gave good supply to both Chris and Raph on the wings. <br>
									<br>
									With AFC camped in the Vags half, AFC turned possession into goals about 25 minutes in. The BFC goalie tried to play it short to a defender but Olly dispossessed him on the edge of the box, beat another defender and then coolly rounded the keeper to tap the ball in. 1-0 baby. Around this time Jeff came on for Sami and Trent came on for Ben to spice things up. After the goal, AFC continued to control the game and with the Vagabonds showing very little unity or creativity, AFC were rarely threatened with Jackie merely a bystander in the Wanderers goal. 5 minutes before the end of the half, Yusuke(I think) was taken down outside the box on the left side and &ldquo;Colnel&rdquo; Raph 12 Euros bent a lovely curling shot that hit the top of the net. That was the last thing worth mentioning in a half that saw AFC squander 4 or 5 very good chances and should have been 2 or even 3 goals up. <br>
									<br>
									After a few halt-time words the Wanderers went back out and started the second half as they had left off from the first half, passing well and scavenging for every ball. Jeff, a new lad playing in defence made some very timely challenges and was bringing the ball out wonderfully for AFC. The first 10 minutes of the second half were pretty uneventful, BFC making some changes and it being fairly balanced. Olly had a shot that went over and Trent blazed over on another.  <br>
									<br>
									The first real chance of the 2nd half came 25 minutes in from a corner, Raph putting in a lovely ball that was cleared away at the last minute by a Vags defender. At this point AFC started to lose a bit of shape possibly down to tiredness and the game ended up having both sides long balling it to their attackers.  As both teams were getting tired and with the Vags looking for the equalizing goal, the game was wide open with some desperate tackles going at both ends. The last 5 minutes saw the Vags go close twice, one from a defensive mix-up that left the Vags veteran Adrian one on one with Jackie who saved excellently and then their young striker  blasted a good chance wide with less than a minute left. With the final whistle came the joy and relief of the AFC manager and three points, only one less than the total for last season!<br>
									<br>
									There are a lot of good points that came from this game, AFC kept their shape for the majority of the game and new signings Jeff and Trent proved their worth. With a big advantage in possession that they failed to turn into goals, it took a very well taken goal from Olly to split the sides. A great team effort but especially from Eric, Les Bleu played out of his skin and never stopped tackling in the entire game. Good game lads, next up &#150; Copel FC. <br>
