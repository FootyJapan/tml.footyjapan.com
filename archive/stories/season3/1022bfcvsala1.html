								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 22nd October. </b>Under an October Manchester sky at the Hachioji ground, the pre-match kick in was going well. Shots predictably flying off target, mis-hit crosses, fluffed ball control, headers pinging off into space.  Suddenly a ball swung in perfectly from Wiganer Neil to be headed firmly into the net by Evans. The man from Kenya was momentarily stunned, this was no ordinary ball, this ball had been pumped to the max and now had the feel of a heavyweight medicine ball.  He dusted himself down, and got straight back to business. In a funny kind of way, this embodied the BFC never say die spirit today.<br>
									<br>
									The warm up began without forwards Jon and Neal, both deep in fag ash and discussion. This laxness earned themselves a bollocking from captain Phil in no mood to let  standards drop. After the previous week's slip up against the Swiss, this week there was a determination to close the gap on the league leaders.<br>
									<br>
									The game began at a furious pace, Sala keen to close down space. BFC were unable to get their flowing football going and in the first 20 minutes captain Phil had to leave the game with a calf injury. Fourth choice central defender Dave Long was brought off the bench to link up with James Morson, perhaps the smallest central defender in the TML, but possibly the best header in the BFC backline. The new defensive line up stuttered to get started and a breakdown in communication led to Sala breaking away to score just before the first half. Straight from the kick off Paul Wadsworth played a ball in to Jon Day who was just able to put his ciggy away to wallop a beauty into the net, 1-1 instant reponse.<br>
									<br>
									BFC vocal support was supplied from a near hoarse temporary manager Brian Doyle, accompanied  by Vagabond legend Adrian Thomas and Amy and baby Alfie. As they roared the BFC forward a breakaway from Sala's nippy forward showed the ring rust at the back to slot home another. Still the BFC refused to let it lie and attacked in search of an equaliser. An awkward ball was swung in from the left that the Sala defender was judged to have handled, a penalty to the BFC! This decision infuriated the Saladians who felt unfairly treated by referee Kazu. The penalty was easily slotted by Neil Collins, making the scores even at 2-2.<br>
									<br>
									The game now took on an extra competitive edge as both teams surged forward in search of the clinching goal. An excellent pass down the left found Jon Best making a rare forage into the box, but what a time to make a run. He took control of an awkward bouncing ball and lobbed the advancing keeper. As the ball bounced languidly into the back of the net Best was mobbed by his grateful teamates.<br>
									<br>
									A BFC resolve to stem the Sala attack and hold out for the 3 points was now the plan for the remainder of the game. A late Sala attack was foiled by the heroics of keeper Jyrky, diving at the attackers feet  to pull of a match winning save. The man they call Beef Jerky had saved the BFC bacon once again.<br>
									<br>
									As my old manager Howard Kendall used to say, &quot;If you don't concede goals you've got a great chance of winning games&quot; Well the BFC  turned that advice on its head and are showing a determination to win even when not playing to its full potential. Once the passing game returns as new players fit in, key players return from injury, fitness improves,  this juggernaut will take some stopping.<br>
