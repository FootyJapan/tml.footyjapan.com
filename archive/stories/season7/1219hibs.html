						<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunrday 19th December. </b>Hibs were of course expecting a tough game against the reigning champs at fortress Yokohama, but not a steel cage match. YCAC came in right away with several brutal tackles and a flying elbow by perennial sportsman Joe, and as we duly responded the game showed signs of boiling over. About 15 minutes in, Satoshi Mitsuda lashed out against Raffa after a foul that had already been called, and the referee showed him red. A tough call to make in a big game, but the right one, and it probably avoided an outright slugfest. It also meant Hibs were up 11 men to 10, and we slowly got control of the game, but they mostly sat back and made it tough to operate. Our biggest chance came when Andre got free inside, only to put his shot over the crossbar, and 0-0 it was into halftime.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							In the second half both sides wore down and there was more room to play. YCAC fought for every inch of ground, but going forward with the Hibs defense holding strong, their only two real chances came on free kicks - Hitoshi tapped one over the bar, and a rare mix-up at the back saw a header trickle through, 1-0 YCAC. Hibs had far more chances on the night, and McGirr put Tomo through a few minutes later to slot it home calmly, 1-1. Mike missed narrowly on a few more shots, Raffa was close on a header, and Andre rose up to meet a cross from Yohei only to see it go just wide, so a draw it was. Mixed feelings after the game, we were so close to getting our second, but then we finally pried some points off of YCAC on their home ground, where they are vulnerable<br>
