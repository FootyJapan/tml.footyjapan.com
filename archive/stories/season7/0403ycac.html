						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 3rd April.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							YC&amp;AC demonstrated another series of brilliant team effort, scored three goals and cruised to a 3-0 shutout against TML rival BFC on Saturiday night.<br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;AC and BFC both created some scoring opportunities during the first half, although it was YC&amp;AC that broke the floodgates while Danny Rawlings kept his sheet clean with tremendous savings. Shigehiro Yamazaki set up by Russ Philp fired a bullet straight to goalkeeper Tomoaki Nishihara who was only left to see the ball deflect off his hands into goal. Rock solid defense displayed by Matthew Taw, Kento Nakamura, Kaname Shoot managed well with Shosuke Yamagishi, which successfully ended the 1st half with a 1-0 advantage for the home team.<br>
							<br>
							Two more goals in the 2nd half from Anthony Savage as he stole the ball away from James Morson just as Morson was trying to &quot;libero&quot; out of the BFC defense line, and another strike after a Neil Shonhard effort chasing the ball against Nishihara ended up seeing the ball bouncing in front of Savage. <br>
							<br>
							Despite defeat by YC&amp;AC, BFC captain James Morson and friends found more answers than questions among themeselves, with some of them playing impressive football. Shosuke Yamagishi was incessantly a danger with his flashy skills through the passing of Carlos Aranda. With Jon Day, Evans Kunyaga returning back to the front, things may get even better. <br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;AC travels to Singapore next week to play in the <a class="txlink" href="http://www.sccsoccersixes.com/" target="_blank"><b>SIngapore Soccer Sixes </b></a>against teams such as Malasia U19, Singapore U19,U21, U23, Chonburi FC, Beijing Guoan Talent FC, etc. YC&amp;AC will be back home for TML competition on April 17th to play against Sala, kickoff scheduled at 13:45.<br>
