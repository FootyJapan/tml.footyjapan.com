						<p><b>Horisaki Koen, Saturday 3rd April.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Geckoes made a dream start on Saturday night, with Jonas Mogui scoring a brace inside ten minutes. Their domination continued until mid-way through the first half when FC International clawed themselves back in to the match, pushing a loose midfield ball in to the area where it was laid off and finished from 4 yards.<br>
							<br>
							The next fifteen minutes saw FC International wrest control of the match, but a battling display in Centralk Midfield from Rob Snaith and some resplendent passing from the Scouse Valderrama, Simon Bromwell, saw the Geckos attack drawn in to the game more before the half time whistle.<br>
							<br>
							The second half started well, with Geckoes debutant Andy Beresford dispossessing the opposition from the kick off and instituting a lightning attack which was unlucky not to bring a goal. The resultant punt forward from FC International, however, did produce a goal and the tie was level.<br>
							<br>
							Parity did not last long, with Rob Snaith marking his impressive performance and restoring the Geckos' lead.<br>
							<br>
							But then the game turned sour for the Geckoes. Whilst the next thirty minutes saw some excellent approach play and produced many chances for both teams, FC International took advantage of the Geckoes' injury ravaged defence. When FC International came away with a fouth goal after a clattering challenge on the Geckoes goalkeeper, whilst in full possession of the ball, it seemed that the writing was on the wall. A fifth quickly followed and the Geckoes were shell-shocked.<br>
							<br>
							Despite this the they did not give up. An expert finish from Andy Gill, taking his season tally to seven, brought the Geckoes back in to the match. But for some rued missed opportunities in the last ten minutes, they could still have come away with something from the game, which would have been the least that they deserved after an absorbing display..<br>
