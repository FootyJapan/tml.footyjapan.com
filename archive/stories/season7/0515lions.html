						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 15th May.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Lions scored probably the fastest goal of the season, with Jets kicking off, and barely having 2 touches, Yasu on the left wing picked up the ball, twisted and turned a player, dashed past the next, broke into the box, and laid off a beauty to an unmarked Ahmed G at the far post to put Lions ahead with barely 60 seconds gone!<br>
							Omar could&rsquo;ve doubled the lead with a fierce shot from the &lsquo;D&rsquo;, but well saved and tipped over for a corner.<br>
							The game was evenly balanced, until Jets equalised with a sweet curved ball from the edge of the box past Orlando half way through the first half.<br>
							The lead didn't last long as Ahmed G weighted a perfect ball to Abu, who dashed into the box and from 8 yards out hit a rocket into the top near Jet&rsquo;s goal to put Lions 2-1 up.<br>
							The second half saw Jets start strongly, and as a Lions defender held up his hand for an offside, the Lion&rsquo;s linesman flag stayed down, and a Jet&rsquo;s player was all alone in the box, but his shot was well saved by the inform Orlando.<br>
							Jets then had a couple of headers go wide before Abu broke the offside trap (Ahmed G was off, and linesman flag went up, but credit to the ref, he played Abu on who ran from an onside position) and no keeper wants to face Abu on a 1-on-1......and the finish was as cool as his old afro cut....making it 3-1 Lions.<br>
							Abu, who only scored his first goal this season last month vs Hibs, almost had his hat-trick, as his overhead kick beat everyone BUT the post......falling back safely into the keeper&rsquo;s hands.<br>
							With 10 minutes to go, I came on again with Notti upfront, replacing Ahmed G and Abu, and Notti&rsquo;s great performance was almost rewarded by a goal as he dashed into the box, but his shot was hit straight at the keeper, credit to the defender pressing.<br>
							A few minutes later Notti decided to take the shot early, and hit a neat 20-yarder, to make it Lions 4 &#150; 1 Jets.<br>
							Omar came on again and couldve had a goal himself with a few minutes to go, but his 15-yarder was hit straight at the keeper, who saved well again.<br>
							Entertaining match, and Lions for the first time had some flowing football this season, and thoroughly enjoyed the win, the weather, and a good contest.<br>
							Man of the Match: Great play from all, but it has to go to Abu, despite a pre-match injury, scored 2, played his heart out in a free role that suits him well.<br>
