						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 22nd May.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							TML Season 5's MVP, the skillful Jorge Kuriyama looked less than &nbsp;ordinary in a thrilling game between Lions and FC International. The game had High Quality everywhere..one of the best referees, three &nbsp;honest and accurate linesmen (myself, Aziz, and Rouven)...great &nbsp;weather on a perfect surface...and quality football that made the &nbsp;Champions League final look even duller than it actually was. Had both teams had average keepers, the score mightve been approaching &nbsp;the double figures...but not because of bad defending, but for awesome &nbsp;football played.<br>
							<br>
							The flicks, the nutmegs, the chips, the dribbles, the layoffs....with &nbsp;hardly the ball going out of play....even the ref Alan, thanked both &nbsp;teams for a highly entertaining match.I won't write about the whole game, as I won't remember all the &nbsp;chances and plays, and if I did, this report would be as long as a &nbsp;novel!<br>
							<br>
							Lions started strongly, and Ahmed Zahrani (AZ) laid off the ball to &nbsp;the debutant Yasutomo, who hit the ball from 7 yards out straight at &nbsp;the keeper...almost putting Lions ahead in first minute again (as vs &nbsp;Jets)<br>
							<br>
							A few minutes later, a perfectly weighted ball from Omar saw Ahmed &nbsp;Gaafar (AG) outrun the defence and hit a sweet low driven shot from 15 &nbsp;yards into the bottom right to put Lions 1-0 up. 2 minutes later, Sukui cut in from the right and hit a similar shot &nbsp;but from 20 yards out to make it 1-1..and that was the only shot Sukui &nbsp;managed as he was blocked and marked closely. AZ then laid off the ball to Yasutomo who broke into the box, but fell &nbsp;cheaply as he felt a defender approaching, and rightly so, no penalty. FC attacked and a floated corner was headed in well to put FC 2-1 up. 5 minutes later, AZ passed through a defender on the left corner of &nbsp;the box and hit a scorcher across into the far inside of the side &nbsp;netting, making it 2-2.<br>
							AZ couldve doubled his tally with a Bergkamp style curler, but well &nbsp;saved by the French keeper.<br>
							End to end stuff continued, and a Marco cross couldve landed in goal, &nbsp;but for the safe hands of Orlando.<br>
							<br>
							2nd half saw FC start better with Tony fashioning many chances and &nbsp;looking like the most dangerous player, along with Michael's bursts &nbsp;into Lions half, but Notti, Yuki, Keishi, and Sima were in top form &nbsp;with Orlando pulling amazing double saves. 3mins or so into the half, Yasu, Abu, and Omar linked up well to lay a &nbsp;ball 4 yards out at the far post, only for the experiences AZ to hit &nbsp;the ball 4m high! 2mins later a perfectly lofted freekick from Sima fell to AZ 7 yards &nbsp;out, and his looping header was saves acrobatically by the Frenchman.<br>
							<br>
							Marco broke for the first time after a clearance deflected back, and &nbsp;as the defenders pressed him and Orlando rushed out to the edge of the &nbsp;box, his chip just cleared the bar to keep the score as-is. A similar break on the other side saw AG one on one, but the keeper &nbsp;came out quickly to the edge of the box, and AG instead of going for a &nbsp;chip tried to round the keeper, who got a leg to the ball, and save &nbsp;his side. FC pressed and a great tackle from Omar saw FC shouting for a penalty, &nbsp;but rightly so, waves on by a great ref.<br>
							<br>
							FC had double chances with a block and a shot from 7 yards out tipped &nbsp;by Orlando, who then got up and caught the ball on the line. A last chance fell to FC about 5 yards out, but the shot was similar &nbsp;to AZ's and was too high.<br>
							Man of the Match: Lions FC and the Ref, followed by FC International &nbsp;and the linesmen!<br>
