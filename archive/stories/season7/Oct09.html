								<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 31st October.</b><br>
									&quot;They will definitely be taking the P**S out of us for doing this warm up&quot; is what I said in between the inward and outward leg rotations to open up the groins as it were. Our ritual of winning every game after warming up as a team ended in a well fought game. Without too much real goalmouth action the game was played in good spirit and at a very competitive level. Overall I think the result was fair.<br>
									<br>
									Credit to the Vags I think they defended very well and perhaps our decision to go with just one out and out striker proved to be a bit too cautious as their back 3 gave very little away and made life difficult for the division's top scoring striker Sho. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season7/1031pants.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

TML Organizer, Sid, was once again asked if he could set up a friendly match for the men in kilts. As before (<a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season3/0514tartanarmy.html" target="_blank">report on last visit</a>) he obliged, setting up a 3 way tourney with YCAC Old boys and Tokyo's Celtic Supporters Club joining the TA.<br>

									In the first match, Tokyo CSC beat the YCAC Over 35's 4-2. The Old boys then took on the Tartan Army, taking a 1-0 lead right into the final stages of the match before the TA kitted out in a very nice St Andrews Cross strip, equalized just before the end. The Final match was a battle for the Tartan Challenge Sheild between Martin Burns' Tokyo CSC and the TA led by Mark Sims. CSC took this by storm 4-1 despite going a goal down, but it was all played in great spirit.. <a class="txlink" href="http://sport.scotsman.com/scotlandsfootballteam/It39s-a-case-of-.5723407.jp#4509071" target="_blank">more from the Scotsman ...</a><br>

								<h1 class="red">TML NEEDS YOUR HELP</h1>
								<p>Setagaya Koen, 10 minutes out of Shibuya, has a beautiful 3rd generation pitch (some of you may have played there last season). Unfortunately it is usually used for baseball so it's difficult to book it for the league. It has come to our attention that from November 1st, despite having floodlights, the ground closes at 5:00pm instead of 9:00pm as it does in the summer. This is because baseballers don't play in the cold winter evenings &amp; they have been closing early since the days when it was a dirt ground. We have spoken to the Ward Office about having the ground open til 9:00pm during these winter months as us footballers would be happy to use it, but of course getting this done could take a while as it must go though committees that will take time to process the request. What could speed up the process is if they get lots of requests through the 'comments' page of their website. If you don't read or write Japanese, please could you ask your spouse, girlfriend, co-worker to fill in the form (<b>JAPANESE ONLY</b>) <a class="txlink" href="https://www2.city.setagaya.tokyo.jp/goiken/iken_kumin_csv.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> requesting that the ground be made available in the evenings from November. Don't worry if you don't live in Setagaya-ku, anyone can fill in the form, the more the merrier! This could help us secure a much needed ground in a very good location.
