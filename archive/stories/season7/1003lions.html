									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 3rd October.</b><br>
										Again Lions had barely 11 players to start with, due to 4 or 5 players busy in the African Festival, and with a week of rain, the pitch was a challenge.<br>
										Lions fashioned a handful of chances, but with a few golden opportunities missed as close as a few yards out could&rsquo;ve easily seen Lions 5-0 up at half time- culprits: Ken, Abu, Mo, Hussein, Momo!<br>
										..But a great through ball and linkup between Ken and Abu, saw Hussein turn the defender and place a looping shot over Maeda to put Lions 1-0 up.<br>
										Orlando then denied Zion with a brilliant save from a volleyed shot only a few yards out, seconds after Abu&rsquo;s low driven shot was held by Maeda a yard in goal, but it was impossible for the referee to call with no linesmen. This was the first real chance for Zion, with the Lions back four of Yuki, Yasu, Notti, and Mo Birkia playing brilliantly together and giving Orlando an easy time in goal.<br>
										The introduction of Momo for Abu saw him play a great through ball, and with both Ken and Hussein played onside, Maeda just reached the ball first but kicked it straight to Momo who placed the ball wide with an open net, but from 30 yards out.<br>
										Lions&rsquo; debutant Keishi played really well on the right flank, and his skill and work-rate made him a much welcomed talent to the Lions team.....and he could&rsquo;ve opened his account with a well driven low shot that was pushed out for a corner.<br>
										The second half started with a great through ball to Ken who was brought down by what seemed to be the last defender, and a free-kick was awarded (but no cards) 25 yards out. Fahd&rsquo;s free-kick was headed against the bar by a Zion player, and the ball fell nicely to Momo a few yards out, allowing him to open his account for Lions and making it 2-0.<br>
										Abu came on for Hussein, and a great cross-court ball from Momo to Abu was well taken, and as he rushed into the left side of the box, he skipped past a defender and cut the ball back to Ken who opened his account for Lions this season and making it 3-0.<br>
										A crossed ball from Zion fell nicely to Nixon, who&rsquo;s quick reaction made him slot past the rushing Orlando, making it 3-1 and allowing the striker to beat Orlando for the first time in 3 years.<br>
										The hard working Tatsuya in midfield then came off in the last 10 minutes, and the re-introduction of Hussein saw him net an easy ball for Lions, after Fahad&rsquo;s 30-yarder beat Maeda in goal, and bounced off the bar into the path of Hussein.<br>
										A last minute free-kick saw Momo hit a scorcher only inches above the bar....final score 4-1 Lions.<br>
										Hard to choose from the back four, but Notti&rsquo;s forward runs gave him the edge.<br>
										<b>Man of the Match: Notti</b><br>
										<br>
										Lions now go into the next game against a high-flying BFC, but with the current leaders only managing 1-point against Lions last season, surely this will be a game to look forward to!<br>
