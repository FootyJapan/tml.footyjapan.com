						<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 28th November.</b><br>
							It had been a while. Not since the first day of the season had BEFC won a game. Last week, though, there was much to be proud about in a narrow defeat at YCAC in the cup, and the bare eleven (in number, not stark-naked) that showed up at Oifuto turned in a disciplined performance to notch three long-overdue points.<br>
								Little was known about opponents Jetro, save for the fact that they&rsquo;d recently spanked table-topping El Diego 5-0 and dumped Saitama Jets out of the cup last week. As most all-Japanese sides are in this league, they were comfortable on the ball, and quick in possession. From the beginning, though, the Embassy hustled and harried all over the pitch, pressing and closing-down, and forcing them into misplaced passes. BEFC had opted for a 3-5-2 due to the personnel available, with the excellent Ian flanked ably by Sotoro and Rob looking assured as a three all afternoon. Gary, Takanori and Craig were winning the scraps and headers in midfield, and Masa and Will were causing problems down the flanks. Steve and Ryuta were willing runners and tracked back diligently. Despite the bobbles on the dirt, both sides were looking to knock the ball around, but chances in the first half remained at a premium. Keith stretched well to tip Jetros only shot of note around the post while at the other end half-chances from Takanori and Steve were spurned.<br>
								Ten minutes into the second half, the deadlock was broken. Following some neat link up play, Steve unselfishly squared for Will, who smacked home his first goal in years, a goal that his all-round performance deserved (even his throw-ins looked legitimate for the most part). Jetro looked for a quick response but the Embassy held firm, even at corners - their usual undoing. With time running out, the Embassy broke forward again; Ryuta beating the offside trap to slot home and putting the result in no doubt. <br>
								A thoroughly deserved 2-0 win was a much-needed tonic for the Embassy who had been sliding down the table. The performance will be a huge boost for the rest of the season as with players to come back, and real partnerships beginning to form all over the pitch, the immediate future looks decent. Or, at least we can enjoy next weeks Christmas party.<br>
