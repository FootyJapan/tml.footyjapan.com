						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 28th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							After the 12 goal thriller last time (in which BFC secured the spoils) it was anyone's guess what the result of this game would be following a mixed start to 2010 for both teams. As it was, a devastating display of trickery in the counter attack from BFC's Shosuke was the main difference between the sides, though over the course of 80 minutes the difference was small.<br>
							<br>
							The first half belonged to BFC - to Shosuke. With BFC playing their football high up the pitch while energy levels allowed, BFC quickly established some control. FCI, always dangerous on the counter, were struggling to contain BFC's attacks with Taka, Evs, Taichi and Sho all feeding off Brian 'back in CM' Doyle and Carlos. The first came from a great cross from Sho, with Jon Day rising like a tin of whiskas (salmon of course) at the back post to power home a great header. <br>
							The second came from the spot after the FCI linesman correctly called for a foul on Sho; with Carlos converting from the spot. Full credit to the FCI lino for sportsmanship made us think back to an earlier game in the season when a similar tackle at Hachioji on Sho led to a PK and then ugly scenes from BFC's opposition. Different oppo, different day, thankfully.<br>
							<br>
							FCI always looked dangerous from set pieces and BFC were caught napping at the end of the first half when a looping free kick was nodded home after a goalmouth mix up. Great delivery, 2-1 and game on.<br>
							<br>
							Both teams respect each other which always makes for a better game and although the second half was heated is was never over-heated - respect is the key if you're reading..... With 20 minutes to go it had been pretty much end to end stuff with both defences standing up well and both GKs making good saves in difficult conditions. Then FCI took control as the clock ran down and they pushed for the equaliser. BFC stood firm though and with 5 minutes left on the clock a typical Shosuke run ended in style as he rounded two defenders and smashed home from just inside the box. <br>
							<br>
							BFC then had to endure a torrid 5 minutes as FCI poured on with wave after wave of attack, but BFC's defence were on great form and the score remained 3-1.<br>
