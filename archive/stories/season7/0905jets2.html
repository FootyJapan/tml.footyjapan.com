									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 5th September</b><br>
										A good game of football between JETS 2nds and Y-Abe on a humid evening on the beautiful Hanno ground was won 3-1 by the JETS to get their season off to a nice start.<br>
										Y-Abe is a decent team and seemed to have bolstered their side over the summer break. The Jets on the other hand have lost a couple of key players over the summer. Nevertheless, the Jets, playing a 4-5-1 formation today, got off to a good start in this match, pressing and harrying to give Y-Abe little time to think in midfield. Hide and Denis did a good job in there and the defensive line-up of Masato, Oli, Simon and Justin were solid but for a couple of dodgy back passes and kept Y-Abe chances to hopeful potshots in the first half. Yasu did well in his stint on the left and Deryk and Calvin put in a couple of battling appearances in the midfield.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The two first half goals came from Nate Gildart, of course, who looks to be on good form. The first goal came via Isaac who sent an accurate ball in from the right wing. The second came with Hiro neatly linking up with Piper who slid the ball in to Gildart to fire home. The first half saw a few chances go begging also. Piper got wide on a couple of occasions to set up Gould, who replaced Gildart up front and was unlucky not to get on the score sheet in the first half. The ball was also laid back to Hiro on the edge of the box who fired in a belting shot, but straight at the keeper. At the other end Y-Abe came closest with a long-range effort that looped oddly over Kosuke in goal. The veteran managed to recover excellently to tip the ball over the bar.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										2-0 at the half and all looked good. The start of the second half however saw Y-Abe getting on top and they were eventually rewarded with a goal &#150; a shot coming back off the bar to get knocked in. There were a couple of other scares for the Jets due to a couple of mix ups between keeper and defense, on of which saw the ball drift alarmingly across an open goal, somehow managing to get all the way out for a throw on the other side. The game was finally killed off with Gildart sending a nice pass through to Gould, who bustled his way through on to goal and finished with the alacrity he lacked a little in the first half. The whole match was played in great spirits with tackles flying in firmly but fairly. Y-Abe is an excellent bunch and play the game with good skill and speed, probably creating more chances than I gave them credit for in this report due to the failings of my aged mind. Thanks should go to the referee, who let the game flow by playing some good advantages and taking no nonsense.<br>
