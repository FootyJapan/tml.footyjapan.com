						<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 21st February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							BFC started the day with 14 men, by kick off they had 10. Doyle, Day, Denham and Ring lost to the a ticker tummy, work, amnesia and drink - the gaffer is not happy. 4-4-1 it is then. Oddly, BFC had the best of the opening 10 minutes and should have gone 1-0 but the post came to Celts' rescue for the first of six times in the game when Sho was put through by Carlos on a beautiful ball. There was another period midway through the second half when BFC were the better side but other than that Celts were generally the stronger outfit. They worked harder going in both directions and were it not for Carlos' ability to create chances from pretty much anywhere they would have taken a point; they probably deserved one.<br>
							<br>
							As it was a fairly poor game ended 3-2 to BFC with Carlos scoring a 40+ yard free kick with almost the last kick of the game. Prior to that Celts had taken a first half lead after a nice finish from Takeda after good work from Henry....good work, albeit good work having once again been given too much time and space to dictate things in the space between defence an midfield - something BFC did too much of for the final 30 mins of the first half.<br>
							<br>
							BFC's first goal came from Pabs. Drafted in half way through the first half to take them to 11 and playing against his wishes, in someone else's boots, with a hamstring injury and the marathon next weekend. His instructions were just to sit on the last man and do nothing, don't jeopardise the marathon, don't jeopardise the sponsorship money for the kiddies' playground.... But this is Pabs we're talking about: one goal, one assist, no marathon, no swing for little Billy. The second was a great team goal starting from the back and calmly finished by Evans - during that 15 minute spell it was one way traffic. However, Celts fought hard and with a few minutes to go it looked like their tenacity had paid off with a toe poke to make it 2-2 - Takeda again.<br>
							<br>
							It probably would have been a fair result but with a minute to go Taka is fouled just inside the Celts' half and up steps Carlos to loft a long free kick home. 3-2 BFC and everyone is forgiven..<br>
