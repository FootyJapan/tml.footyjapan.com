						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 8th November.</b><br>
							The trek to YC&amp;C is always a highlight of the season - climbing up the hill from Yamate station, regretting that last pint from the previous night every step of the way...finally finding your way to the ground led by a waft of fried food...<br>
							<br>
							The Dutch squad was 15 player strong and was eager to challenge a seemingly struggling YC&amp;C 2nds side - little they knew that this would prove to be quite a struggle.<br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;C fully utilized their physical advantage successfully targeting their forwards with long balls, and the Dutch struggled to set up their wingers because of slow manouvering.<br>
							In particular, YC&amp;C skipper Philodemus Denham and defense highlander Steve Taw put on an impressive performance for the team in grey.<br>
							<br>
							After a fairly even first half, YC&amp;C increased pressure on the orange back and got close to scoring several times. However, as cruel as the beautiful game is, the first time the team in orange manag ed to spread their attack wide they took an easy lead with Jun slotting the ball in the YC&amp;C goal from the right.<br>
							<br>
							With 5 minutes to go a frustrated YC&amp;C side turned the match even more physical crossing the legal line several times...the ref could have easily dismissed one or more of their players but deided to let rough play go. Nothing really happened to the end of the game.<br>
							<br>
							To sum it up, sometimes you get lucky - just like checking out one more club before cutting your losses on an eventless night in Roppongi, sometimes it pays to try.<br>
							Better luck to YC&amp;C next time (not against us).<br>
