						<p><b>Todoroki, Sunday 25th October.</b><br>
							The Geckoes ground out a tough win on the muddy Todoroki dirt pitch against Zion Sunday night. The Geckoes started very well and put Zion under lots of pressure which told after 10 minutes, ending in a superb shot from the top of the box by Yu Kawane, giving the keeper no chance. However we let them back in it after that and didn't score the second goal which may have killed the game off. It was pretty even for the remainer of the first half and both teams had chances.<br>
							<br>
							The second half was more competitive and probably marginally belonged to Zion and they will probably think they were unlucky not to get something out of the game. However, the Geckoes defended well and put in the tackles and got the ball away when we needed to. Yu Shirai was sent off for a moment of madness, he seemed to be fouled by the Zion player but the ref didn't blow his whistle which prompted Yu to foul back, the ref then wanted to show the yellow card, Yu was understandably upset and pushed his case a bit too far and the ref sent him off. Probably a bit harsh on Yu who had a great game before that. After that it was all hands on deck defending for the Geckoes and we got our second and killed the game off finally as the ball was cleared forward to, Man of the Match, Yu. He picked it up and finished very coolly after running in on goal from the right.<br>
							<br>
							Notable was a strong return for Nat who played well in defense all day, making one great clearance letting the ball run across his body running towards his own goal hooking it out and away to safety. Andy Gill gets the team commitment award of the day by putting in his shift again in defense even though we all know he wants to go up front and score. It turned out to be the right decision (this time made by Brommie) as he did very well again at center back. Thanks Andy. Also a notable return for Paul James, still nursing an injury but encouraging to see him back in action. Mikkel also did well again in his second game on the trot up front and dropping back to the midfield after Yu was sent off..<br>
