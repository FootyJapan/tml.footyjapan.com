						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 10th October.</b><br>
							Despite their highest ever finish in the TML last season (4th) the Kanto Celts did not manage to beat any of the top three. Having been beaten by YC&amp;AC and Hibs already this season, it would have been hard to back the Celts for this one. The sense of relief and achievement come the final whistle on Saturday was clear then, as the hoops pulled off a real upset toppling the high flying BFC. <br>
							Only through the tireless work of Gavin manager did Celts have the required number to take the field in the first place. Numerous withdrawals saw Gavin traipsing round the Irish bars of Tokyo on Friday night looking for anyone with an Irish granny.<br>
							Celts knew that a special performance was required to compensate the obvious superior technique of BFC. The Celts started crisp in the tackle, fully committed to every ball and the opening exchanges were quite even. BFC showed how quickly they can pounce though as John Day, despite the presence of three defenders, managed to get a toe to a cross but the ball came back off the post. Luck rode. The refusal to allow BFC the time and space to pass the ball paid off after 20 minutes however, as the BFC centre half was forced into a back pass from the edge of the box. Will, true to form, felt the ball was there to be won and sure enough beat the keeper to it and lifted it over his head. 1-0. Celts were trying hard to build on this momentum and Matthew was proving to be a real handful up front. Indeed the BFC centre half could only bring him down just outside the box when he seemed in after an electric run. Wataru stepped up to place the free kick into the bottom corner (despite Jo&rsquo;s claims for a late touch). 2-0 and BFC looked mildly surprised. Rather than panicking however, they stepped up their game and lots of running off the ball, quick passing, and a lighting quick striker saw the reds come very close twice. They were back in the game before half time as the constant pressure from their right flank brought them reward and the Celts&rsquo; lead was back to one at half time. Celts knew that it was only a matter of time before more was to follow from BFC if they did not get a grip on the midfield. <br>
							The Celts dully fought their way back into the game in the second half though and although it would be wrong not to say that BFC had the lions share of possession, the Celts put in a hugely brave display, defensively solid, committed in midfield, while still maintaining a threat on the counter. When Tomo and Will had to go off it really was backs to the wall and the much needed calming influence of Ben Reeder was key. Despite constant pressure BFC did not really get many shots on Aki&rsquo;s goal although their striker did hit the top of the bar for the last kick of the game. Full time, the Celts had done it. Hoodoo broken. Managerless (on the day), six first teamers out, two injuries sustained, Toru and Jo playing out of position, the Celts put in an immense performance to hold on for a famous victory.<br>
