						<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunrday 19th December.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							YC&amp;AC closed their 2009 schedule with a 1-1 deadlock against the Hibs and remained unbeaten on the year for TML competition.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Despite a one-man disadvantage due to an early sending off, YC&amp;AC held on quite tightly and managed well to keep the Hibs away from goal. And although with the initiative of the game mostly in Hib's hands, YC&amp;AC was successful to nick&nbsp;a goal from Hitoshi Ono. A quick freekick taken by Anthony Savage sought the head of Kazuki Oshima before Ono's challenge.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							However, 15 minutes to go in the 2nd half proved to be too long for the 10 men&nbsp;YC&amp;AC squad to walk away with three points; minutes after, Tomomitsu Kunii, who created trouble for the YC&amp;AC defense down the flank with Yohei Ota on the other side, neatly finished on a clean counterattack, 1-1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Hibs tried for another, though YC&amp;AC seemed to be happy with a point in hand; nothing special or noteworthy thereafter.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Finally, sayonara and farewell to Mike McGirr who is due to be leaving Tokyo soon. Encountering a perhaps tough yet fair tackle for a fifty-fifty ball at the beginning of the game somewhat bothered and occupied the 27 year old Irishman's (Englishman I believe &#150; ed) mind throughout the entire game. &nbsp;A few moans and groans towards the referee and a few choice challenges too far from the referee&rsquo;s eagle eye followed the initial exchanges. &nbsp;However, it seems that football is so fascinating it can surpass almost anyone's normal behaviour off the pitch. So we love you Mike, you are a great player.&nbsp;<br>
