						<p><b>YC&amp;AC Saturday 9th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							<b>The Kit</b><br>
							Move over Leon Trotsky (aka the artist formerly known as Kevin Gray).<br>
							Eschewing the customary New Year's greeting a flustered BFC captain kicks off 2010 with: 'Al what's the worst thing you think I could have left behind?'<br>
							Wife: check. Kids: Check. Both of them. Normally Evans 'cleans' the kit (giving the BFC players that delightful odour of stale Marlboros which has been scientifically proven to boost the team's performances). Alas.<br>
							Upshot: BFC spend a frantic 20 minutes rifling through the lost-and-found at YCAC for spare shorts and socks. Kazuki Tadoroki has no shirt and contemplates bare-chestedness. 'Saco' Sakai tries on a pair of very smelly Hawaiian beach shirts. BFC look gay.<br>
							<br>
							<b>YCAC rock up in GREY. GUN-METAL GREY. GREY is well hard. BFC look gay</b>.<br>
							<br>
							<b>The Game</b><br>
							The teams line up and BFC are dressed in orange string-vest bibs looking a bit like the Village People. Who were also gay.<br>
							This is not a dream start to 2010. Honestly. Wiki! Just lost an entire match report. Not happy. Redoing this. Will be brief. 'Boston Legal' is on the telly. Don't whinge. You could have got Evans!<br>
							BFC started on the back foot, save for one corking cross from Taka Imai which Les Ferdinand would have gobbled up. Captain James Morson called for water for cramp -- after five minutes. Alongside him Sakai had a fever of 38.2 and was playing like Les Dennis.<br>
							Battering the 'Les' metaphor to death, many of the players on show were positively Dawson-like in their movements as the ball pinged off shins, cannoned into Mars bar-shaped bellies and rarely caused the goalkeepers to look up from the comfort of their deckchairs.<br>
							It really was a splendidly crisp day, blue skies, salty sea breeze and stuff. A brief spell of sharp one-touch football broke out from BFC but lacked end product. Birds chirping.<br>
							YCAC looked to use their greater size advantage with the more direct route. Kids on the swings in the playground and that.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Polished Ring</b><br>
							Karl Ring showed some nice touches on his return to the BFC after a long absence, but it was Imai who finally broke the tedium, shaving the crossbar with a free kick from 25 metres, before Evans, busier all over the pitch snapping into tackles, tried a snap shot on the turn and Pablo Pomares looped one into the car park.<br>
							Goalless at the turnaround BFC fancied their chances of sneaking a rare away win at YCAC, who also had a few players looking like they had scoffed one too many Brazil nuts over the festive period.<br>
							But with Shosuke Yamagishi not in the mood to cross the ball and Imai's threat being snuffed out after the break, BFC lacked bite.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Sucker punch</b><br>
							As turkey-stuffed players flopped to the astroturf with cramp willy-nilly the game had 0-0 written all over it until YCAC struck on the counter, flooding down the left in the space Yamagishi had, not for the first time, failed to track back into.<br>
							A low cross triggered panic in the BFC defence and the loose ball fell -- horribly for the away side -- to Jo Takeda, who fired the ball into the top corner via a slight deflection to put YCAC ahead with 15 minutes left. BFC could not believe their misfortune.<br>
							YCAC celebrated like they had won the World Cup.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Cometh the Hour</b><br>
							Cometh the Kaz. Or sumfink. BFC had not exactly gone into 'Launch it!' mode but Jon Day's cross from the right had snow on it when it finally came down with barely a couple of minutes remaining.<br>
							It was YCAC's defence who went into meltdown when it re-entered the earth's atmosphere, however, and as they flapped about wondering how to deal with it, Tadoroki thundered the ball home with a spectacular overhead kick to give BFC a share of the spoils they deserved over the 80 minutes.<br>
							BFC celebrated like they had won the World Cup.<br>
							The End.<br>
