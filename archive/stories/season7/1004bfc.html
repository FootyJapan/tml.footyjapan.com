						<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 4th October.</b><br>
							This was always going to be a difficult one. The match report I mean. Who can actually recall 12 goals in detail? Wish I was writing the Lion 'n Zion report. You could play around with that all day. The new Referee that TML managed to ship in from her majesty's shores specially for this game was probably wondering whether he had boarded the wrong vessel and ended up in the southern cape of Africa for the ICC trophy finals. He was quite good by the way. More of him please.<br>
							<br>
							FC Inter had already claimed points against the Hibs and trounced a few weaker teams to announce their arrival at the top league with great pizzaz. They elected to bat first on the beautiful turf in ASIJ (Home of the Mustangs) eager to claim their first scalp and duly got on the board within five minutes. Their slippery left winger found the by line via a couple of skinned defenders and with a deft cut back laid it on a garnished platter for their striker who dispatched it into the top left. BFC&rsquo;s response was concerted and immediate as they poured forward in numbers. The leveler arrived in the form of a great cross from Pabs from the right wing. Yes, a great cross a la Gerrard against Hull that somehow eluded everyone to and flew into the far side netting. BFC were happy to take it in any form or shape against the resilient new boys. Inter by now were driving the game at a blistering pace that was threatening a few nosebleeds in the surprisingly blazing October sun and the gaffer was right to start rolling the subs early on. FC&rsquo;s constant probing and attacking paid off when they grabbed a second after a half cleared corner. Their number ten attempted the spectacular with an audacious overhead kick that was going wide only to find a lurking colleague at the far post who guided it in. (How do you tell when someone is lurking? And why are they always lurking at the far post?) That number ten by the way is one bulky boy and a dead ringer for Morimoto, the best Japanese striker to emerge in recent history currently banging in the goals for Catania in Sicily but bizarrely still hasn't earned a call up to the Samurais in Blue. And together with perennial predator Sukui Ono, they continued to give the BFC backs a torrid time through out. BFC tried to play the ball around the park but no one seemed able to put their foot on the ball long before the Inter boys came snapping. They were unlucky though not to draw level before the break. Carlos smashed one from 20 yards that thundered onto the bar and rebounded almost back onto the halfway line. Sho, perhaps trying too hard to impress his new hottie, was guilty of blasting high on one occasion and then choosing to shoot rather than pass to Carlos who calmly pointed it out at about 140 decibels in a foreign language. The first inning though was all FC&rsquo;s and the beloved former BFC left back Rouven Wozzy, now captaining the new side, looked quite happy with his boys at the break.<br>
							<br>
							Meanwhile, there was some soul searching to be done by the boys in red and the captain asked for more grit and hearts worn on sleeves. They responded in the second half that degenerated into a ping pong of sorts and a strange roller coaster of emotions. The few spectators at hand were treated to a 9 goal thriller in 40 minutes. 9 goals! That, I'm sure you have already worked out, is a goal every 4.4444444&#x2026;minutes. They came in so thick and fast and furious that this humble scribbler recalls a few BFC members arguing what the score was at one point. The goal rush started when Carlos whipped in a great free kick for Sho to bundle in to draw level at 2-2. Then they scored. Then we scored. Then they scored I think, Then we scored. Then we scored again. Then they scored. Apologies but the how and who is beyond my 5MB (that is upto-about-5-goal-a-game memory) capacity. Honestly, it was that haphazard and every time the ball went forward another goal was chalked in. Suffice it to say that from 3-2 down, BFC found a way to bang in a quick three goals that seemed to put them in the driving seat but Inter, unlike Sol Campbell, wouldn't just walk away.<br>
							As the fatigue due to that frantic pace that FC were playing at in the first half started to tell, BFC started picking them apart though the right flank and quick counter attacks. From 5-4, BFC showed more tenacity and determination to force in two goals to secure the points. It was hardly a classic though and most goals weren't very pretty. The pick of the crop was courtesy of Shosuke who beautifully curled the ball over the advancing keeper after being put through by Alex. No one clearly stood out but Shota was in good form fighting hard and winning headers in the middle of the park, a bit of a mystery when you look at his staggering 3 foot frame. Carlos did bang in from 20 yards, his preferred territory, as the goalkeeper somehow contrived to let it in from his grasp. Sho and Pabs bundled in one each, Alex had a simple tap in after another spilt freekick and there was an own goal from Alex's through ball to Shota. If you are confused about the order of goals, you aren't alone. FC did score a well worked free kick late on to leave the score at 7-5 and were still camping in the BFC half at close of play. Had this been Old Trafford and they had the obligatory 20 added minutes, who knows what the score would have been.<br>
							<br>
							By the end, the new boys had proved that they are here to stay and will be asking questions from any team in the top division. BFC meanwhile will be happy to walk away with 3 hard earned points by showing the stuff of champions; true fighting spirit. Something we will surely need in huge amounts next week as we make the trek out to South Chiba to face our boogie team Celts who should be very determined to jumpstart their season.<br>
