						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 23rd January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							Lions had a very challenging game playing at YCAC, the usual pitch or an unfamiliar new look?.....a 5th corner flag! <br>
							Lions felt they were playing on 5 sided pentagon pitch with Zion&rsquo;s linesman keeping his flag up throughout the entire game!<br>
							It was amazing how runs from behind defenders and from our own half were still offside....<br>
							Lions were just about 11 players, with a first rare start for Aziz and Hussein as the central midfielders, but with the late arrival of Momo and Charley, midfield positions were swapped around with great effect.<br>
							Keishi had a great run on the right and his across the goal low driven shot was just missed by the sliding Abu.<br>
							Ahmed Alzahrani was getting very frustrated by being called offside everytime he touched the ball, and the one time the referee ignored the linesman, Ahmed was through and put a tame shot past the keeper, that was cleared bravely off the line by a defender.....Ahmed later admitted that he thought he heard the offside whistle again!<br>
							Sima missed a header from a yard out, as he over hit it above the bar.<br>
							Ken was rugby tackled off the ball in the box (non-intentional), and our shouts for a penalty were waved away.<br>
							Eventually Sima made up for the early miss with a fine finish at the far post from a corner.<br>
							1-0 at half time, and I was looking across to see if the Zion linesman was getting any massage for his surely tired arm by now!<br>
							The second half Lions started playing better football, and a perfect near post cross from Keishi was finished professionally by Ahmed Alzahrani into the top near corner to make it 2-0.<br>
							Zion moved the ball well, but Sima and Orlando were having a magnificent game at the back, nullifying all Zion efforts.<br>
							Ahmed was through again, and as he passed the ball across the goal, Ken running from behind a defender, got to the ball and finished his 5th of the season....BUT amazingly was ruled for an offside!..Yes..really!<br>
							Momo and Charley had fine runs past 2-3 players and as they both entered the box, their finish was disappointingly wide.<br>
							In the last minute, a cross into the Lions box saw Notti and a Zion striker tangle legs and fall together, but a penalty awarded!<br>
							Orlando had no chance with a well struck penalty to give Zion a flattering 2-1 loss....<br>
							Zion are playing better football now, but did miss some fire power upfront with Benji missing.<br>
							<br>
							Now on 13 points and with BFC losing.....the TML table looks like becoming more interesting than expected with only 3 points separating 3rd from 7th!<br>
							<br>
							Great performance from Ken, Ahmed, and Keishi.<br>
							<b>Man of the Match:</b> Sima, looked like taking bullets for the president as he protected Orlando....and for opening the scoresheet<br>
