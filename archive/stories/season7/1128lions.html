						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 28th November.</b><br>
							Lions went into the game looking for all 3-points in this 6-pointer, to open a gap from the bottom, in an attempt to bridge it with the top half of the table. Lions had good team, but missing the influential Abu, who could only play 10 minutes due to illness.<br>
							Sala only had 11 players, and had to play the full match with no subs or a linesman, but Vladimir (ref) did well throughout the game that saw only 1 booking to a Sala player.<br>
							Lions started strongly (as always), and Omar had a sweet turn and shot that saw Taylor rooted to the ground and helplessly watch the ball clear him, but luckily deflect back off the bar.<br>
							Sala had a few good crosses from the right, but all their headers went too high. Some panic in Lions defence saw Sala through and shoot, but Orlando showed that he had no intention of conceding a goal today...and a double save frustrated Sala.<br>
							Omar then bisected the Sala defence with a great through ball, with Ahmed Gaafar outpacing the defence and slotting it nicely past Taylor to put Lions 1-0 up.<br>
							Fahad had a great run down the left and as he teed the ball up for Somi, his 16yard shot went agonizingly wide of the right hand post.<br>
							Ken showed great strength as he held off a defender and hit a magnificent shot on the turn, unfortunately inches high.<br>
							The second half saw Lions dominate the first 20 minutes and should&rsquo;ve scored a couple when Omar was 1-1 with Taylor, for the latter to save brilliantly. Omar again had a great chance to double the score when another great run from Fahad on the left saw the ball cut across the box to an unmarked Omar who hurriedly took a week shot.<br>
							Keishi patrolled the right flank well, and a few of his crosses caused hammock in the Sala box, but still no goal.<br>
							Sala finished the game strongly and in the last 10 minutes were through twice, only for Orlando to pull some amazing double saves, and the last chance fell to Sala&rsquo;s number 10 who turned the defender superbly and hit a sweet ball on the half volley with the left, only to go inches wide....however Orlando looked like he had the goal covered with his dive.<br>
							Its been over a year since Lions kept a clean sheet, and its about time with good defenders and a great keeper.<br>
							Tight but entertaining game and in good spirit.<br>
							Man of the Match: Ahmed Gaafar....the young lad scored the only goal of the match, and worked tirelessly upfront<br>
