						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 21st February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							This was a six-pointer. Embassy&rsquo;s slide in recent weeks, culminating in a 4-0 drubbing at YCAC last time out, had the alarm bells ringing. A meeting with an improving Barbarians, who had beaten us last month, was a massive test of character, and thankfully a test that was passed&#x2026;.just!<br>
							<br>
								A collective hangover after an excellent day at the races added another challenge to a journey into deepest, darkest Chiba on a chilly Sunday evening. Thankfully, a depleted squad was boosted by some &lsquo;loanees&rsquo; from King George (cheers lads!) ,and so unlike the previous encounter, there were subs to call on. John slotted in effortlessly alongside Ian at the back, James harried in midfield and Sean put in a shift on the flanks. The Embassy began well. An excellent throughball from skipper for the day, Rob, found Steve who took it in his stride but couldn&rsquo;t beat the keeper. He wasn&rsquo;t to be deterred though as soon after, he took a pass from Silv, kept composed and slotted home &#150; 1-0.<br>
							<br>
								The Embassy were good value for the lead but Barbarians upped the tempo, relying on long range passes and countering down the left. The tricky number 10, cut into the box, Tim dangled a leg, and a penalty was awarded despite the protestations from er&#x2026; Tim. Converted, 1-1 and  that&rsquo;s how it was at half-time. The beginning of the second half saw the Embassy regain the initiative, and, following a period of pressure, the lead. Richie soared down the right, crossed the ball over, and James got a toe to the cross to convert. The lead was extended following a move of real quality. Alex, as he does so well, held the ball up, twisted and turned before playing a lovely reverse pass, which Steve rifled home to cap the best weekend of his life ever.<br>
							<br>
								3-1 and seemingly comfortable, panic typically reared its ugly head. Swarms of Barbarians laid siege to the Embassy goal, but the evergreen Keith, playing with painkilling injections, thwarted attacks with great diving saves and brave dives at feet. It was going to take a huge piece of skill or great slice of luck to beat him and the latter it was. A ball into the box caught the Barb offside, but despite the raised flag, the ref awarded a penalty from the ensuing play. Again converted, 3-2, and squeaky bum time. One off the post, one off the line, and more heroics from Keith ensured a valuable three points were claimed and pushed the Embassy a few places up in the table.<br>
							<br>
								So, a welcome win, and a great effort form all the boys. Ian was imperious as always at the back, Masa covered every blade of grass ten times over, and Will and Richie kept driving forward while Rob, Tim and Si tackled diligently. Alex and Steve linked up as well as ever before, Silv never stopped running, and of course Keith stood up when it mattered. More of the same and the Embassy should be looking upwards rather than over their shoulder.<br>
