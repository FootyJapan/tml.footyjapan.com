						<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 20th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							A highly charged encounter between Jets 2nds and Stoneds, saw the Jets triumph 1-0 thanks to a deadly blast of&nbsp; Tomo &lsquo;n&rsquo; Turner mid-way through the 2nd half . On a cold night in Hanno, the Jets took a giant stride in their promotion push to TML2 by doing the double over Stoneds and making it 3 wins in a row.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Stoneds are well-renowned throughout TML 3 as a potent goal threat, averaging 3.8 goals per game going into the fixture, and the league&rsquo;s second and third top scorers (slightly behind the Jets&rsquo; league-leading Gildart). However a superb all round performance by the Jets ensured that this tally was not added to, and in fact Keeper Kosuke was only seriously threatened once in the whole game - making an outstanding save with his feet from a snap shot just inside the area about 30 minutes into the action.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The first half was quite cat and mouse, with neither team taking too many risks, and both trying to get a strangle hold on midfield. The Jets 3-5-2 formation started to pay off as the half wore on though, with Denis, Hide and John starting to win the 50-50s, but unable to offer decent service to the strikers. The trusty ball over the top was causing problems, but the Stoned&rsquo;s fleet-footed sweeper was always on hand to, well, sweep up.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The second half&nbsp; saw the Jets demonstrate their credentials as potential league winners, with everyone getting stuck in and a nice balance was struck between keeping the opposition out and searching for the winner. In fact early on in the half it could have been game over but for some dodgy decisions. First Nate was played through and after the keeper parried his shot Calvin followed up with what should have been the opening goal, but instead the linesmen put up a flag despite Calvin coming from a good 5 yards behind the ball when it was shot.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Several more controversial offside flags denied further one-on-one chances for Nate, and when he finally did get away unflagged, he was professionally fouled only for the defender to escape with a yellow. Still the Jets kept up the pressure and a series of 4 corners whipped in by old man Tomo Kobayashi caused havoc in the Stoneds defence. Captain Rayner had the clever idea that Turner, Rayner and Gildart should use their weight advantage to pile in chaotically at the back post, and sure enough Turner headed home a clinical header to put the Jets ahead.&nbsp; He celebrated by whipping off his glove and whooping a Canadian whoop.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Stoneds tried to get back in the game, but Kosuke was not called upon to repeat any heroics and the Jets held on for a thoroughly deserved win. &nbsp;Cue more whooping in the stands after the game, and probably on the bus and over beers at the izakaya after that too. It&rsquo;s hard to single out any players for special praise as the whole team was superb - probably the most solid performance EVER from the Jets 2nds. Woo hoo!!<br>
