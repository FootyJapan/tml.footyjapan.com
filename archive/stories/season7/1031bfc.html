						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 31st October.</b><br>
							The timing of a fixture is so important to how the weekend pans out....a victory early on a Saturday and the rest of the weekend feels so much sweeter, and so it was to be for BFC against a resilient Zion.<br>
							<br>
							BFC knew Zion had some fire-power having run YCAC close the previous weekend but, despite this, and despite only having 9 regulars in the team, BFC pretty much put this game to bed in the first half after bagging a couple of goals shortly before half time: Carlos swinging home a beauty of a free kick and Evs coming up with a gem of a control, turn and first time shot into the corner of the net, making it 3 for the Eggman in as many starts, not to mention a hatful for Vags.<br>
							<br>
							A 2-0 half time lead would normally see BFC home safely and, if anything, you'd be expecting them to bang in more as the game wore on but with with a few of the lads looking out of sorts and a few unfamiliar faces in the mix, BFC never really got going in the second half. However, with the defence looking rock solid and with Robbie and Carlos keeping control of the midfield, BFC were never going to lose this game.<br>
							<br>
							Credit to Zion who fought to the final whistle and defended well throughout but one fears they need to register a win soon to avoid dropping straight back down. For BFC it's another 3 points leaving them holding their own in the TML mix with the usual suspects also there or there abouts - a long long way to go though.<br>
