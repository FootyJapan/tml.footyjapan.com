						<p><b>Futako Tamagawa, Saturday 18th December.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							Panthers made their Nikotama debut on a cold and blustery sunny day down by the river. The pitch, heavily used throughout the year was bald and muddy in the middle and divoty on the flanks. Perfect conditions for wingers to shank crosses. Combined with the winds flying off the Tama, a beautiful game was not on the cards. <br>
							Pretty in pink as ever, the Panthers got into their groove quickly, looking to release Dan on the right on Mori on the left. There were a few half chances and gentle testers for the Jetro keeper before the pressure told and Jetro conceded a clear penalty. First penalty of the season for the Pinks and dispatched with a blast by Ben. 1 nil. Jetro were trying to get into the game, but the back 3 of Lars, Saco and Alan Yang dealt with any Jetro forrays forward with ease. The second came two thirds of the way into the first half when the Jetro keep contrived to slice his clearance towards Mori on the left wing who stretched and directly volleyed the ball into the goal from about 35 yards out. Only Mori will know if he meant it, but with regular Panthers mascot and devoted girlfriend Miho watching on the sides right next to wear he hit it, we will give him the benefit of the doubt. She usually does.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							And so halftime came and went with the Panthers confident they could extend their lead. However, the first 20 minutes of the second half proved a frustrating one with the pinks unable to really get hold of the ball and play. This allowed Jetro to push on and create a few chances. Kieran in goal stood firm and produced a confident display. Best save of the day came from point blank range form a Jetro forward who was then adjudged to be in an offside position. Alan was up for it and won all of his 50/50's and most of his 30/70's, great athleticism from the full-back.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							John Dagley enjoying some good match time, was getting into the game storming up and down the right and getting some well timed sliding tackles in. The panthers midfield led by an impressive Barua were starting to get back into the game until like buses, the pinks won a second penalty. If the first challenge on Sho wasn't a penalty, the Jetro full-back made sure with the second desperate lunge and it was Sho himself who took the honours this time, converting confidently. The Panthers pushed on with Mark flashing a header just wide after good work from Ma before Saco sealed the win with a nice header from a corner 5 minutes from time<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Without really playing too well, the Panthers won quite comfortably in the end, bringing the 2009 campaign to a close undefeated in the league. The ref had a good game and the match was played in a good spirit. Merry Xmas and bring on 2010!<br>
