						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 25th October.</b><br>
							Lions went into the game against the Champs, with many changes including Kaneko in goal for Orlando, Momo and Mo Birkia in defence for the injured duo of Sima and Notti. The midfield was also missing the key holder, Fahad.<br>
							Abu and Ken who caused BFC so much trouble were both available but with strapped up ankles, we were not sure if they would last the full game.<br>
							From the kick-off, both teams showed that they relish attacking football, with Lions close to releasing Ken who's first touch put the ball closer to YCAC's keeper. YCAC hit back with a great far post cross that was amazingly headed wide from 6 yards out. YCAC then fashioned another good move on the left, and the far post cross saw their striker side-foot a volley inches above the bar.<br>
							Ken was released again, and as he was outpacing the last defender&#x2026;the defender kept close and looked like any contact would get him sent-off, but he managed to slow down Ken, who passed the ball to Ahmed AlZahrani on the right&#x2026;Ahmed then dashed into the box, and he halted and looked up, he crossed a far-post inch perfect ball to an unmarked Omar who hit the ball sweetly from 8 yards out into the top left corner of the goal to put Lions ahead after 15 minutes.<br>
							Lions could've doubled their lead when Ahmed and Omar linked up well on the right, and Ahmed left the ball for Omar to shoot from 8 yards out into the side-netting.<br>
							Ahmed Gaafar then had a 30 yard shot saved well, minutes after Ahmed AlZahrani tried a similar ball that led to the first goal, this time the keeper intercepted the cross well.<br>
							YCAC kept plucking, and when the goal scorer passed a ball back to a pressurised Momo, his clearance was deflected into the path of the left winger who cut a low-driven cross for YCAC to tap in from 12 yards out to level the game.<br>
							Kaneko was great in goal for Lions, especially when YCAC broke the offside trap twice, with a one-on-one saved well by Kaneko. The inform keeper was however at fault when the YCAC right-back cut in and hit a bouncing shot with his left from about 20 yards out, only to see the ball bounce just before Kaneko and slips through his hands to give YCAC a 2-1 lead at halftime. Questions should be asked of Lions allowing him so much time to shoot, especially 5 minutes after a similar shot went marginally high.<br>
							The second half saw Captain Gaafar Somi come on for Ahmed Gaafar&#x2026;and his introduction started to fashion good build up play from Lions, but an attack on the left from YCAC saw them cut the ball across the goal for an easy tap-in. 3-1<br>
							Ken then had 2 through runs where he outpaced the 2 defenders in a way that made bystanders cheer him on&#x2026;.only for his finishes to go wide, and saved by a brave keeper. Momo then had a vicious 40-yard shot fly a foot too high, before his header from a corner also went high. Momo then released an inch perfect, bisecting ball from his own half to again release Ken, who from a few yards behind the defenders, again out-paced them, and finished (off the rebound) to put Lions back into the game at 3-2 with 10 minutes to go.<br>
							Lions then started throwing everything forward, and great build up play on the left by Somi, Abu, Omar, and eventually a layoff for Somi on the far right edge of the box, saw him drill a fierce low-driven shot, only to hear the 'clank' of the post raise a few moans and cheers from the unexpected crowd, who seemed disappointed that such great play didn&rsquo;t end in a deserved goal.<br>
							With little over 5-minutes to go, YCAC hit again, in a similar fashion to the 3rd goal, only on the right side, but with the same outcome to make the final score 4-2.<br>
							A fantastic game to watch, well refereed by Vladimir, and the smile on the face of both teams and the 25+ crowd (waiting for the rugby game) said it all on the quality of football played.<br>
							Lions gutted, playing well, but again nothing to show for it! The enthusiasm is building up, and with the next game against a Sala team who had similar praise and misfortune as Lions, surely that would be a game to watch.<br>
							Difficult to choose from Somi, Momo, and Abu too.<br>
							<b>Man of the Match: Ken Hersche, injured, yet scored and ran the YCAC defenders ragged!.<br>
