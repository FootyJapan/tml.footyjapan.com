Two narrow loses to YCAC and BFC added to a heavy, heavy loss to Hibs left the Celts wondering what they had done to upset the footballing gods. Celts also felt hard done by the 1-1 result earlier on in the season between these two teams. <a class="txlink" href="0227celts.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

									I love rain, early mornings and epic journeys to far away lands, so another round of TML fixtures was just the ticket. This time the venue was Yamate&rsquo;s very own YC&amp;AC. The fixture: Pumas vs. King George FC. The last meeting was decided by a late goal scored by the league&rsquo;s Gubernatorial Grand Marshal and international &lsquo;Tall Guy&rsquo; Sid Lloyd in a 2-1 win for the Pumas. KGFC were out for revenge and the all important 3 points it comes with; revenge is a dish best served cold, so the heavy rain and Arctic winds were fitting conditions. <a class="txlink" href="0228kgfc.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

									</b>After the 12 goal thriller last time (in which BFC secured the spoils) it was anyone's guess what the result of this game would be following a mixed start to 2010 for both teams. As it was, a devastating display of trickery in the counter attack from BFC's Shosuke was the main difference between the sides, though over the course of 80 minutes the difference was small. <a class="txlink" href="0228bfc.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>
