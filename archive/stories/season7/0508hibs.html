						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 8th May.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Saturday night's battle royal between league leaders at YCAC wasn't pretty, but Hibs will take it. Since the debacle last year when they booted us off the pitch and down the hill back to Yokohama, we've added a few pounds, some of it useful for football. A special thanks to Edu and Andre for all of their extra pounds.<br>
							<br>
							As both teams cleared their lines early, it was the Hibs bigger defenders that won the headers at the back and balls in midfield, and we gradually forced them into their half. Andre was a beast all day, basically playing one-on-four up front, and when one of theirs got mad and took him out, Yohei calmly stepped up and blasted in the free kick from long range for the crucial first goal, 1-0. Edu, who asked to start so he could play &quot;before the energy drinks wore off,&quot; also had a great game, finishing off a string of passes by roofing a shot from inside the box, 2-0.<br>
							<br>
							It looked like the green tide had things under control, but YCAC are too strong to stay down, against the run of play one of theirs chipped Hitoshi from about 40 yards, it takes a good shot to beat him and this one was, skimming the crossbar on its way in, 2-1. We held them off the rest of the way, Big Dave and McKenna anchoring the back with Kuni more than holding his own on the right. Tempers were hot and almost boiled over after a brutal elbow chop foul by a YCACer, but the ref immediately stepped in with a yellow to calm things down. 2-1 into half. Things were tense in the Hibs camp at halftime, but a group hug helped.<br>
							<br>
							In the second we had more chances than Josh in his Reds gear in Urawa, but unlike him just couldn't seal the deal. Edu smashed an amazing volley only to see it hit the post, and later we were away 3-vs-1 after clearing a corner only to see play stopped for ... something. YCAC poured forward and we were on our heels, but fought them off - Dan putting it in a few good challenges and James with several nice runs out of the back, then later a nice exchange down the left ended with a cross into Tomo, who finished calmly for the 3-1 clincher. A great game, and YCAC were gracious hosts in their bar after.<br>
