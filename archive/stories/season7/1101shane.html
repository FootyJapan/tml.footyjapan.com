						<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 1st November.</b><br>
							&ldquo;A free beer for the first man to score in the new kit&rdquo;<br>
							<br>
							With a depleted squad following a heavy combination of marriage parties, hangovers, injuries and just plain fate a much reduced Shane FC made it to Yokohama for an evening kick off and the opportunity of grabbing 3 much needed points against lowly Guarana Republic. <br>
							Starting the match under the flood lights and with 12 players Shane aimed to put their recent loss to Y-ABE behind them with a confident display and a much needed three points. <br>
							Kick off in Yokohama saw Shane lapse into their new and charitable routine of starting the game about 5 minutes after the opposition and allowed the Guarana boys to come on against them and grab a toe hold in the Shane half. For the second time in two weeks the opposition drew the first blood of the match by going a goal up through a header that beat the Shane defence and left the keeper helpless. 5 minutes gone and 1-0 down! That woke Shane up and they decided to get into the game and attacked Guarana Republic with purpose with the midfield working to probe the defence. Shane began to get shots on goal and began to edge closer to an equaliser as shots from &ldquo;Young&rdquo; Adam and Shane&rsquo;s primary left footer and season returnee Victor sent shots zinging over and close to the goal. Two teams were in the game now and Guarana, despite their bottom of the table status showed that they had grown as a team since the previous encounter between the teams and elected not to roll over and let Shane into the game, for added measure a strong shot by the fast Guarana centre forward pinged off the bar half way through the half. <br>
							Shane must have thought they had gotten a deserved equaliser when a fantastic bit of play from Shane&rsquo;s &ldquo;quiet man&rdquo; Hikaru (and current top scorer) got a low shot in from the right side of the 18 yard box, the team all thought it had gone in but instead the keeper beating effort struck the left post and bounced out into the area and towards the surprised and lurking &ldquo;Paps&rdquo; Gardner who had a chance to claim the elusive equaliser and a free beer after the game. With a defender rapidly closing in nerves apparently got the better of the hapless striker though and he sent his shot just wide of the goal itself to a chorus of disbelieving cries and jeers! It should have been 1-1.<br>
							Late in the first half a three man crunching tackle &#150; or maybe just a three man pile up &#150; left Shane&rsquo;s player manager Dan limping off to the side lines with an injured ankle and Shane were forced to commit their linesman and sole sub to the pitch, it was a Battle of Britain time (only this time set in Japan and with plenty of Japanese and Mexicans involved) and all the reserves were in, no reinforcements, no hope for tired legs!<br>
							The first half ended 1-0 with Guarana on the back foot but tenaciously holding on to their lead.<br>
							To add drama to the proceedings the skies over Yokohama opened up in a heavy and concentrated downpour of rain and the pitch became slippery and hard to read. Shane had the morale boost of seeing their injured player manager return to the fray following some hasty half time surgery and despite the apparent pain &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; got himself back into the action and leading by example as all crazy men do. <br>
							The second half saw more of the fast paced play of the first with Shane perhaps edging the play yet with the surface being slippery and the ball tending to skid the final crucial passes and through balls were increasingly likely to skid away from their intended targets and prevent a final decisive move from coming off. The midfields of both teams remained locked but it was the Shane boys who seemed to be becoming the targets for an increasingly physical and at times dangerous tackling Guarana Republic team. Part way through there came a critical moment, one of the Guarana defenders intercepted a dangerous through ball on the left side with a decidedly deliberate and unsporting handball and thus earned himself a yellow into the bargain. It would prove to play an important role in the eventual outcome of game. <br>
							Guarana continued to attack though and it was only the efforts of &ldquo;Rockus&rdquo; Rick the day&rsquo;s Captain and his back four heroes as well as a number of great saves from the Shane keeper that kept the dreaded counter attack goal at bay. Guarana though looked to be on course for a surprise win though when they went did manage to go 2-0 up mid way through the second half thanks to another header, for Guarana there was jubilation and a scent of victory, for Shane it was horribly familiar feeling as once more the team found itself playing good football but the victim of sucker punch goals. <br>
							Shane proved last season that they never roll over and fade away and so taking stock and reorganising the pack the team set about making the most of the final 20 minutes of the game. Shane&rsquo;s MVP Masa shifted into attacking midfield and added assurance and thrust to the game. Shane pressed, Guarana held on, the rain fell.<br>
							With 7 minutes to go luck finally smiled on Shane as the same Guarana defender who had handballed earlier in the half once more handballed, this time in the area and got himself a second yellow for his efforts. Down to 10 men and facing a penalty Guarana were suddenly on the back foot. Masa stood up for the penalty and knocked the ball into the bottom left corner beyond the keepers reach, it wasn&rsquo;t a classic penalty but under the circumstances no one was complaining and thus Masa earned himself the distinction (and a free beer) of being the first goal scorer for Shane in their new kit. Shane didn&rsquo;t stop there and realising that there was a real opportunity to salvage the game everyone pressed forward to grab an equaliser. Being on the back foot Guarana seemed to waver and barely 3 minutes after conceding a penalty another defender chose to play basketball on the edge of the area and gifted Shane a free kick 18 yards from the goal. Cometh the hour cometh the man and it was to be Victor, who had played fantastically on the left all night, who stepped up for the kick. He made a solid low drive into the bottom left of the Guarana goal and seemingly against the odds Shane were level at 2-2. There was a renewed, frenzied finish to the game as both sides went for the three points, Guarana nearly coming close to snatching another goal but the defence held firm. The final whistle went moments later and Shane came off the pitch by far the happier team at having won a point from the jaws of defeat. It was a great final effort from the lads and a definite display of guts and never say die heroics.<br>
