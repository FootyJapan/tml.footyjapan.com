						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 7th November.</b><br>
							BFC vs Hibs has become one of the true TML derbies, even if the Brits have faded a bit of late. Perhaps for that reason, we had over five spectators on the sideline to watch us play, a new record for the Hibs this season (Hopefully BFC is ok with us sharing their fans). They were treated to a great game in which the better team won.<br>
							<br>
							BFC had a full squad while Hibs were missing key players, with Sheriff Dave, our Italian Canavarro Raffa and our green version of Shosuke, Tomo, unable to make the kickoff. Despite both sides putting out defensive lineups the game was back and forth, with Hibs trying to get our passing game going and BFC playing get-the-ball-to-Shosuke-and-get-out-of-the-way. The first clear chance came when Shosuke got the ball, beat a few men and threaded Jon in with a nice pass, but before he could react Super Hitoshi was there at his feet to deny his shot. BFShosuke had the better of the chances in the first half, he made a few more great runs but we managed to bottle him up ok. He drew enough attention that the others got free for some long-range bombs, but nothing to worry about, <b>0-0 into the half</b>.<br>
							<br>
							The second half started with both sides pouring forward looking for glory, we matched up well and know each other, so the question was who would slip-up first? The always-angry BFC defense did when they somehow left Andre unmarked (don't tell them but he was our only forward), and he got a great through ball to go in alone and calmly slot the ball far right,<b> 1-0</b>. <br>
							Of course BFC wouldn't hand us three points that easily, and Shosuke was still running amok - you'd love to hate him but he's such a nice guy. He eventually got in the box, tied up Jay at the back with his speed and earned a PK, Carlos confidently stepped up to the spot, looked at Hitoshi a bit too long and drilled it into the left post, <b>still 1-0</b>. That seemed to deflate them a bit and we poured forward, eventually new recruit Ryo latched on to a rebound from a great save and blasted home from close range, <b>2-0</b>.<br>
							<br>
							In the waning moments they again brought it on and Hitoshi had to come way out to stop yet another effort by Shosuke, his clear went straight to Evans, who lobbed in a weak long-range shot but a mixup at the Hibs back saw it bounce in, a lucky goal perhaps, but they had earned at least one, and <b>2-1 it ended</b>. A great game, one of the best in recent memory between Hibs and BFC. Special thanks to the excellent referee who kept the game under control and did well with some tough calls. A good win, but plenty of football left to play this season..<br>
