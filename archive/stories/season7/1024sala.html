						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 24th October.</b><br>
							Sala slipped further into the depths of TML 1 after yet another hard fought battle against a bickering yet purposeful Hibernian on Saturday evening. &nbsp;A late Mcgirr penalty in the dying moments saw last year&rsquo;s cup winners snatch the points from under the nose of Sala, earning his team a 1 - 0 victory.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The early stages of the match saw much of the play contained within the middle third of the pitch, both sides keeping the ball with only tentative moments of creativity to release respective strikers. &nbsp;A sudden burst from the imposing Sala forward Anderson resulted in a strained hamstring, rendering the Nordic striker to the sidelines after only 10 minutes. &nbsp;The early introduction of Koji Watanabe, only deemed fit minutes before the match, provided a worthy replacement and immediately caused problems for the Hibs defense.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The downpour and the resultant pitch conditions saw possession carelessly given away by both teams on numerous occasions. &nbsp;One such occasion on the Sala left flank mid way through the first half allowed the lively Yasu Yomota to thread a pass to the feet of Kuni Katase, the resultant turn and attempted pass to the Hibs debutant striker saw the ball bundled away by the Sala defense only towards the feet of Hibs new boy and centre half revelation, Raffa Di Marchi. &nbsp;His lofted attempt on goal from 25 yards hit the cross bar only to be picked up by Hibs central midfielder McGirr who then turned and chipped a delightful effort over the stranded Brian Harlow. &nbsp;The effort struck the underside of the bar and bounced to safety.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							A series of Hibs corners followed as the rattled Sala struggled to dominate the penalty box exchanges, each attempt merely being scrapped away for yet another corner. &nbsp;Despite the pressure, resilience told, and the Hibs were unable to produce from the set pieces which were the only effective weapons in their first half armory. &nbsp;Counter attacks through smart interchange within the Sala midfield and calculated shifting of play opened the Hibs defense on a number of occasions, all but 1 effort by the hard working Koji were safely dealt with by the Hibs stand in keeper. &nbsp;A dangerous Sala break from the right saw a failed clearance by the Hibs defense allowing the ball to fall to Koji at the edge of the 18 yard box. &nbsp;A sweetly struck low shot was brilliantly diverted aside and the first half was brought to a close. &nbsp;0 &#150; 0.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Sala team remained unchanged as both teams took to the field for the second half. &nbsp;Spring Chicken Rowley Rademaker, rademaking his first start for the Sala continued in the vain of his first half display with a tireless display of jostling, harrying and tracking. &nbsp;Coupled with raw attacking instincts, the young Dutchman was a constant stone in the Hibs shoe until he was cruelly sidelined with a blow to the ankle. &nbsp;Lenny Tui moved into a more central role and Ryotoro Suzuki took the reigns as left midfield. &nbsp;Attacks set up from wide positions were fizzled out and with the lack of real scoring opportunities from the wide positions both Sala strikers became more and more isolated. &nbsp;A pass into the feet of Tobias Long on 18 minutes allowed the striker to turn his marker and drive an effort safely into the hands of the Hibs keeper. &nbsp;This was followed 2 minutes later by another bustling run by the striker into the box, again only to half hit his shot without troubling the keeper. &nbsp;Guido Geisler now playing a freer a role in the second half was also handed an opportunity from outside the box, his strike also failing to trouble.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Rain soaked uniforms, sodden boots and energy levels decreasing turned the game from neat, cautious passing to a more physical, direct affair. &nbsp;Hibs showed their ability to turn matches in their favour by capitilising on the tiring Sala. &nbsp;Quick forward passing from Mcgirr and Schirmer gradually unlocking the door allowed Andre Pinto to control and turn Paul Clarke on the edge of the 18 yard box. &nbsp;A foul was awarded and from an extremely dangerous position the free kick was cancelled out by the Sala wall. &nbsp;Further interchanges on the Hibs left flank allowed the advancing Hibs captain Jay Alabaster a number of chances to deliver hanging crosses into the Sala area. &nbsp;With no real arial threat in the Hibs attack, each cross was safely dealt with by the Sala defense consisting of Paul Clarke, Ian Jelley and Dan Bard.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Excellent chances fell to Kunii Katase and Andre Pinto on 68 minutes with both efforts being brilliantly saved by Brian Harlow. &nbsp;A bursting run into the box by Josh Schirmer leaving his marker Pete Swinney standing culminated in a shot he would be very disappointed with. &nbsp;The match, still hanging in the balance, seemed destined for a 0 &#150; 0 draw. &nbsp;But, just like the effects of Stadia wind currents on a seemingly motionless beach ball lodged into the back of a football goal, there would be a last minute flurry.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							One of the final attacks of the match saw the Hibs right sided player deliver a dangerous cross into the Sala area. &nbsp;A desperate attempt to clear the ball resulted in the ball allegedly brushing the arm of Koji, and as if at that moment the words &lsquo;who wants ice cream?&rsquo; were blasted out of the Hachioji tannoy system, a barrage of green shirted players arms shot up. &nbsp;The kick was awarded and coolly converted by the Hibs playmaker McGirr. &nbsp;A kick in the balls to the passionate Sala outfit, a tasty treat for Hibs and all toys firmly placed back into the pram..<br>
