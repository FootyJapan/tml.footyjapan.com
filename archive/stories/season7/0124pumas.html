						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 24th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							Another battling performance by the Pumas saw the same result as last week: a glorious defeat. Is there such a thing? Yes. Being part of a 4-3 thriller, full of spirit and determination by both teams does give one a satsifaction that easy victories do not. In both games, not one player looked angry or dejected after the game, more beaten but unbowed, feeling proud. More of this should see the victories come sooner than later.<br>
							<br>
							Two even teams kicked off, but it was the rather younger Shane team came out of the blocks quicker, especially their best player, Giles, who was seen running around like a Jack Russel for about 30 minutes before the game. Maybe warms up are needed for us oldies, as the Shane man buried a cross on the volley on the edge of the box. Came off the post, Kieran had no chance. It was simply a good strike.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Soon after Shane were 2-0 up.</b> <br>
							<br>
							They slipped a through ball down the right after a Pumas attack broke down and their striker finished well to make it 2-0 within 5 minutes.<i> The flag went up for offside, but the referee overruled the linesman, pointing out that 1) he wasn't keeping up with play and 2) he was talking on his mobile phone at the time.</i><br>
							<br>
							
							Pumas soon hit back with Isamu feeding Kev down the line, he beat the last defender but the keeper was out like a shot to make a brave block. Another throughball had the same result with an even better save. Tom put a great ball through to Sid but he was literally blinded by the light, a born again Sid couldn't control it in the floodlights and the chance went. <br>
							<br>
							Pumas then upped a notch and started to control the game. Tom and Warner started to boss the midfield and the back tightened up and started spreading the play to the flanks. Particularly impressive was Lee, who was really strong in the tackle and had a mega throw a la Panthers giant, Rick, that was causing Shane all sorts of bother. The pressure built up with a number of chances we should have buried. Sid <i>headed wide from a Mikhail cross</i>, Tom closed his eyes on a corner tap-in header, and Romen missed from 35 yards with a pass that hit the bar (Romen!!) <i>and nobody following in to get the rebound</i>. The positive thing was the chances were being made. A goal came soon enough though as Tom put Kev through and he rounded the defenders then the keeper to cross for Sid (<i>who'd been screaming for the ball</i>) to tap into an empty net.<br>
							<br>
							<b>2-1</b>.<br>
							<br>
							Against the run of play, Pumas conceded a third after Tom was adjudged to have pushed Giles in the box on a corner. Seeing as it was two hands in the back in front of the ref, it had to be a penalty. Toms hustle in midfiled more than made up for it and he was a bit unlucky that the ref was so close as there was lots of pushing by both teams in the box all game.<br>
							<br>
							The pressure cooker treatment soon continued and payed off when a great team move involving Romen, Warner and Scott, saw Scott use his pace to put in a superb reverse cutting cross into the box on the byline. Three players in the box caused enough chaos for the ball to land for Maurice to keep a cool head and finish.<br>
							<br>
							 <b>Half time. 3-2 and all to play for.</b><br>
							<br>
							The second half continued the same way. Constant bombardment by Pumas. Maurice started to apply his experience down the right and made a lot of useful passing moves. Almost threading through the strikers on many occasions but all to often the ball reaching the keeper before the strikers could get there. <br>
							<br>
							Again like last week, the team effort was incredible. Andy Darton was a tower of strength in the center of defence, Isamu,  Lee, Mikel and new defender, Andrew, snuffed out most of the Shane attack as the opponents were left to pump the long balls that Kieran swept up nicely. Romen was composed and made some great tackles to deny their strikers.<br>
							<br>
							The equalizer was a sure thing. Tom burst into the box past the last defender and hit a great shot that came back off the post. Maurice like last week shaved the post with a great strike from outside the box. Kev headed over from a yard out after a great flick on by Sid.&nbsp; Goalmouth scrambles and goal-line clearances, still nothing. Another open goal miss, and we paid the price as Shane scored from way (35yrds) out, a surprise chip from Riaz, floating over Kieran and into the top right corner. 4-2<br>
							<br>
							Still we had chances. Kev missed another with a one-on-one that the keeper saved again. A minute later, Pumas floated a great ball into the box for Sid 'the Silver Fox' to head superbly <i>back across</i> the keeper for his second of the game.<br>
							<br>
							<b>4-3 and 5 minutes to play.</b><br>
							<br>
							One attack left. we broke 3 on 2. Romen looked up and chose the wrong ball, asking 47 yr old Sid to out-run a 20 yr old defender <i>when a pass inside would have been the better option</i>. Even the Panther captain seemd to panic, which was indiciative of our game all round. If we are to improve, we need to calm down and have time on the ball, too much panic when we get the ball makes us all tense and causes rash decisions. Got to stop calling for the ball just because we want it. At one stage one midfielder had 4 people screaming his name for the ball when he&nbsp; was simply trying to control it and give himself time. There is no point asking for a pass so you can shoot when the person with the ball is in a situation to shoot. This all comes with playing with each other regularly and knowing our own styles and knowing our own role.<br>
							<br>
							Another thing we need to do is stop critizing. we all want to win and everyone played 100% and did their best. Nobody was lazy and everyone bar the strikers played at the top of their game. The strikers lost the game for us as we failed to take our chances. So lets support each other next game and get a win. Next up a tough game against the unpredictable Y-Abe.<br>
							<br>
							<b>Puma's Man of the Match: Tom/Sid</b><br>
							Tom missed a couple of good chances but his work rate was immense. Sid is 47 but ran for 80 minutes and scored 2 goals <br>
							<br>
							<b>Shane's Man of the Match: Goalkeeper</b><br>
							Stopped 3 or 4 one on one chances, and kept his team in it when it looked like Pumas would take over.<br>
