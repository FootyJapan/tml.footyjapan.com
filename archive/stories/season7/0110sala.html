						<p><b>Hachioji Park Sunday 9th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							Happy New Year to all, and best wishes to footy lovers everywhere (except Man City fans).&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Simply summed up. First half: bang, bang, bang.&nbsp; Second half: squeak, squeak, squeak.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							With a 3 goal 20 minute blitz in the first half Sala over-powered Zion in this&nbsp;basement battle&nbsp;and wrapped up the points early.&nbsp; Brookey, Toby and Sam&nbsp;plundered the goals.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							As for the second half?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was just as well&nbsp;for Sala that their first half performance was so good because in the second half the team whimpered and&nbsp;idled around the pitch showing the&nbsp;bite of a gonad-less chihuaha and the street savvy of a Japanese tourist in&nbsp;Rome (remove&nbsp;your LV wallets&nbsp;from your back pockets please campers)!&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Still 3-zip was a good performance, and consistency has&nbsp;never&nbsp;been a Sala&nbsp;watchword anyway.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Fresh from their supreme victory in the NewYear 7's Plate championship tournament extravaganza&nbsp;(world football's 2nd most important trophy in 2010), Sala were looking to put a bad start in the&nbsp;league behind them (Still?? I hear you ask.&nbsp; Yes, I know.&nbsp; Sala&nbsp;have been trying to put that said bad start into an ushiiro position for the last 4 months).&nbsp; Pointless in their last 7 league games, at last they f-ing well&nbsp;did it!&nbsp; Hurrah!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Anyway, enough of the pomp and pageantry.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Play was even at the start with Zion holding posession and displaying a good passing game, whilst&nbsp;Sala played more directly and with more threat&nbsp;than their nihonjin opponents.&nbsp; However, despite Sala's threat, Zion's offside trap was well worked and it stopped a lot&nbsp;of their attacks. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Just as Zion were starting to get the upper hand, Sala broke the deadlock.&nbsp; A mistake on a backpass from Zion's keeper&nbsp;saw Brookey steal in to tap into an empty net.&nbsp; 1-0 Sala.<br>
							<br>
							Sala then stepped up a gear, got to grips with the Zion offside trap&nbsp;and started working some nice combination play leading to numerous&nbsp;chances. In the next 20 mins Sala powered ahead and&nbsp;wrapped up the game.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							First, Shige's strength, determination and customary skill resulted in 2&nbsp;shots, which the keeper blocked, before another move freed &quot;Hot Shot&quot; Lenny &quot;Lennerington&quot; for a&nbsp;shot which the keeper again blocked.&nbsp; Booooo the Zion keeper!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sala's next attack was&nbsp;ruthlessly direct though, and it cut Zion wide open. Shige played a simple lateral pass from the left wing into the middle. Scotty strode onto&nbsp;it before playing a classy first time through ball to Toby whose run&nbsp;was perfectly timed.&nbsp; Left one on one with the keeper he made no&nbsp;mistake with a composed left foot finish into the bottom corner of the&nbsp;onion bag.&nbsp; 2-0 Sala.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							After more Sala pressure the lead was increased to 3-0 from a corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The big Scotsman, Clarkey, powered a downward header across the goal&nbsp;for the ever-alert Sam to nod in at the back post.&nbsp;&nbsp;3-0 Sala.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							A smarter and more accomplished passing team would have seen out the&nbsp;2nd half with some possession play but Sala being Sala this would have&nbsp;been too easy.&nbsp; Instead they played the same direct way that had brought&nbsp;them so much success in the first half and decided to try and re-write the soccer addage book.&nbsp; Lo and behold that old tried and tested addage &quot;Let the ball do the work&quot;&nbsp; is still true.&nbsp; I shit you not readers!&nbsp; Whoever coined that phrase was onto something.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Whilst having to give credit to&nbsp;Sala for chasing&nbsp;more goals,&nbsp;it's like giving an&nbsp;old dog credit for chasing a sports&nbsp;car.&nbsp; With more and more tired and aging legs out there (this reporter&nbsp;included),&nbsp;and Pete off injured,&nbsp;Sala simply didn't possess the energy or youth to keep playing so directly. More and more passes went astray,&nbsp;less running was done and ultimately the 2nd half went to Zion who&nbsp;displayed again that they know how to pass well and keep the ball.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							On the up side for Sala, in the 2nd half, their defence was solid with Clarkey,&nbsp;Ian, Dan, Yusuke and Taylor limiting Zion to few chances and keeping a clean sheet.&nbsp; Final score:<br>
							3-0 Sala.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Otsukaresamadeshita.&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the longest word written in Romaji, I wonder?<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Man of the Match - Shige until he started hogging the ball??&nbsp; Scotty until he started mouthing at all his team mates??&nbsp; Strikers until they stopped doing anything well??<br>
							No!&nbsp; Soooooo....once again....Sala FC (first half).<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sinner of the Match&nbsp;-&nbsp;Sala FC (second half).<br>
