						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 15th November.</b><br>
							The Geckoes were left disappointed not to get at least a point after dominating much of what was an entertaining and well-spirited game. We were the only team to take points in both games last season against the eventual TML Champions, YCAC, and after going in at half-time with much of the play and a goal to the good it looked as if we would walk away with all 3 points this time out. <br>
							<br>
							With Geckoes gaffer Brommy back in the hotseat after his baby-imposed touchline ban, the team adopted a 4-3-3 formation with Jonas and Andy Gill as the bread either side of a Big Paul sandwich up-front. Kai, Kiku and Brommy made up the midfield 3, with new handsome American Pete, Ian, Yu (back from suspension) and Nat lining up in front of Goro in goal.<br>
							<br>
							The game started with the Geckoes midfield and forwards chasing down YCAC, so much so that they had to resort to humping long-balls down-field to gain to respite. The Gecks had much of the possession, however aside from the odd-speculative shots they didn't really trouble the YCAC keeper. That was until player-of-the-season so far, Andy Gill neatly chested down the ball on the edge of the box before volleying the ball over the keeper into the back of the net on the stroke of half-time.<br>
							<br>
							YCAC had clearly had a talking to from the YCAC gaffer at half-time, and started the second half much the better team. They increasingly piled on the pressure and it after a couple of very close chances, it became a case of when and not if they would get the equaliser. Eventually it came from a PK from Joe Takeda after their pacey forward stormed through the defence and left Nat with little choice but to stretch for a tackle that was always going to be difficult to reach. <br>
							<br>
							The Geckoes came back into the game after the goal, but didn't really trouble the keeper. The wind was now becoming even stronger as the game went on, and a YCAC corner was drilled into the Geckoes box (Again by Joe 'I'm not just a 1 trick pony' Takeda) and met by the onrushing Dickie to get what turned out to be the match-winner.<br>
							<br>
							Despite the result, the Geckoes can take a great deal of positives from the game. Andy Gill produced another great display and a lovely goal to sneak the MOM award from Ian, but all in all it was a great team performance with everyone playing their part.<br>
