						<p><b>Shin Suna, Saturday 22nd May.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Actually a malaise, but mayonnaise is far more interesting, especially with tuna fish.&nbsp; Out of the Cup in the semi-final despite being up 2-1 with 6 mins left <b>(4-2 BFC)</b>, and held to a draw in the league by Zion (<b>1-1</b>).&nbsp; Ay carumba, what the hell happened to Sala's unbeaten run&nbsp;of 2010!!!&nbsp; Vanished like a virgin on prom night as Papas would say in Point break.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gets better every team I see it.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Aaaah, how frustrating this game can be.&nbsp; Still I'll love it again if I win the <b>SALA FANTASY WORLD CUP</b>. &nbsp;Check it out!&nbsp; Anyone is free to join; just <a class="txlink" href="mailto:sco22@hotmail.com">email me</a>. <br>

							&nbsp;<br>
							No shame in blatantly plugging something!&nbsp; Unless it's a bumhole with your little finger.......ok, let's move on.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							First half against BFC in the Cup semi-final.&nbsp; Hmmmm...it was crap so let's just go to the second half.&nbsp; John Day scored with a header from a Carlos free kick, although there did seem to be 3 BFC players, including him, offside.&nbsp; Funny that goal&nbsp;didn't appear on YouTube.&nbsp; Oooops, cheeky.&nbsp; <b>1-0 BFC</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Minutes later Sala scored from a big pile of pants own goal.&nbsp; Wicked free kick into the box from Yusuke and some BFC character flicked it over his own keeper.&nbsp; Pants but appreciated.&nbsp;Just like new underwear after you've soiled yourself. 1-1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Both sides hummed and hawed for a bit after that with the defences on top, before Shigeru smashed an absolute corker into the top corner from over 25 yards.&nbsp; <b>2-1 Sala</b>.&nbsp; With 6 mins to go it looked like Sala were going to beat BFC for the second time this year.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							However, two things then happened.&nbsp; BFC's Shousuke swapped wings and suddenly turned into a marauding little monster.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, luck swung BFC's way with a harsh, but probably correct,&nbsp;handball called against Shigeru, of all people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Carlos stepped up and slammed the ball passed Taylor.&nbsp;<b> 2-2</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Shousuke, whose dribble and cross had caused the penalty, then danced round 3 or 4 Sala defenders before&nbsp;being pushed inside.&nbsp; BFC reset and&nbsp;put in a lovely cross, which Shousuke buried with a header.&nbsp; Best player in the league?&nbsp; Definetely in with a shout.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3-2 BFC</b>. <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sala were on their knees and covered in mayonnaise at this point, so it was no suprise when John Day finished for a clinical fourth.&nbsp; <b>4-2 BFC.</b>&nbsp; Total cup comeback-tastic (for BFC that is).&nbsp; Such was the extent of the mayonnaise dripping from the Sala players, and unfortunatley not their WAGS who were present, that BFC could have even added a fifth.&nbsp; Fortunately for them they didn't, or else they would have been called up in front of the Spawny Number of Goals in Six Minutes Committee.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Final Score BFC 4-2</b>.&nbsp; Good luck in the final.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							So, onto the score draw with Zion.&nbsp; Despite cleaning their kits, Sala still hadn't rid themselves of the mayonnaise, and in burning Tokyo heat and humidity, they played a terrible first half against a team who have belatedly turned in some good performances in the last couple of months.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Zion had the better of the possession (Sala&nbsp;couldn't pass water), the better shots (Jason 'he's got a pineapple on his head' Lee had more threatening shots) and the&nbsp;better chances (Sala had the creativity of 5 month old baby with playdo, just botched up blobs all over the place).&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Still, Taylor was looking solid in goal and&nbsp;despite all of&nbsp;Zion's good play, when they did score it was a fluffy&nbsp;little drifting fluke shot that glided &nbsp;over everyone and into the net.&nbsp; One of those ones that looks like a cross.&nbsp; Yeah, you know the type.&nbsp;<b> 1-0 Zion.</b><br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The second half was much better from Sala.&nbsp; After a few changes to the pack,&nbsp;and with better possession, more threat and a lot more shots they got their mojo working.&nbsp; Oooh sexy!&nbsp; Chris hit the bar with his first touch.&nbsp; Shige had a shot saved.&nbsp; Scotty&nbsp;forced a fingertip save with a long range zinger before&nbsp;working the&nbsp;keeper again&nbsp;with a header.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Then, the equaliser came.&nbsp; Scotty broke through the middle, drew out the last defender before slipping a through ball to Nick, who showed some nice jets to round the keeper, before being brought down.&nbsp; Penalty kick!&nbsp; Guido stepped up and placed it top corner.&nbsp;<b> 1-1.</b><br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The game was there for the taking at this point with both sides having numerous chances, but no one could find the winner.&nbsp; Stu, missed his monthly sitter, and with the last kick of the ball Sala were denied another penalty after a strong shout for handball in the 6 yard box.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Alas though, it wasn't to be.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Final Score 1-1</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Man of the Matches</b> - Dave ( a second Bear cometh)<br>
							<b>Sinner of the Matches</b> - Ma yo na isse Scotty (soz for the belated match reports).<br>
