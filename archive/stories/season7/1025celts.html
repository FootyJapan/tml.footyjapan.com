						<p><b>Hanno, Sunday 25th October.</b><br>
							A two nil win over one of our many bogey teams allowed Celts to continue a decent little run. On the back of a morale boosting hard fought victory against BFC, it was another decent performance by the hoops and goals from Jo and Pete were just rewards.&nbsp;<br>
							Hanno or more like Hannoi is a fine pitch but in a different time zone to Tokyo. And like all long haul flights there was a routine security check before we could board Sam's smooth ride. As 8 of the team were meeting at Roppongi, standing on the corner beside the Hobgoblin, three friendly bobbies approached us. It must have been their wet dream to catch so many criminally intent foreigners hanging around suspiciously and I.D us all while continuing a search of Sam's pimped ride. While finding some incriminating tunes no &quot;drugs or Knives&quot; were luckily found, suggest they try Elland Road. As for the journey you know you have travelled a long way when you are stuck in traffic and still have 60 km left on the navi. It must be a 140 km round trip to Hanno.&nbsp;<br>
							Anyway to the game. We only had 12 players but a good solid team. Jets started off brightly and it took a few robust tackles from Masa and some decent crosses from Take to awaken the Celts from their Jet lag. Shots started to fizz wide and over especially from Toru and H as the pressure built up without a clear opening arising. H had a couple of great chances included one where he chased down a backpass to the keeper, won the ball back and then coming in from a tight angle with only the keeper to beat saw his shot bounce back of the post. Half time saw the hoops happy with the performance but missing the end product.&nbsp;<br>
							Thankfully it only took 5 minutes into the second half for Jo to produce a great finish after great work by Take and H down the right. Jo had a couple of more chances in the second half, one in particular where he peeled off the centre half and attempted a curling shot into the top right hand corner that just went over. Other great chances came and went as Pete saw one cleared off the line after great work down the &nbsp;left by Will and Jonesy and Pete also saw another shot come off the crossbar. The Jets started to get some possession and were winning the aerial battle in midfield with their number 10. One nervy moment saw 2 or 3 Celt defenders going for the same ball which then saw the ball trickle past Aki's far post. With about 5 minutes to go Pete made sure of the result with a good finish very similar to the one which had been cleared off the line earlier.&nbsp;<br>
							Good performances all around and also well played to Jets who contributed to an entertaining game. Also thanks to the ref a new face on the TML scene who contributed to an open game.<br>
