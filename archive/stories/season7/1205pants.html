						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 5th December.</b><br>
							I'd checked the weather forecast on the tele in the morning; a fluffy white cloud with a few water drops in the top right corner.  OK, we're on!  The long-awaited clash between Panthers and El Diego, both promoted last year and both riding high in division 2.  As with last year for this fixture, Roman was leaving nothing to chance and had hired a car to ferry the stragglers to deepest Chiba.  Just how many people can you get into a Suzuki &ldquo;compact&rdquo;?........you'd be amazed.<br>
							<br>
							The weather had started to turn ugly long before we arrived at the surreal setting of Fukuda Denshi.  The local chemical works was doing an overtime shift and spewing out some evil-smelling gunk which was immediately dumped on the pitch as acid rain.  You have to really love your football to want to do this!  Not to be deterred, Roman had us out doing our &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; warm up and we were ready to go.<br>
							<br>
							The game got off to a lively start with Panthers dominating and playing some slick football on the increasingly wet surface.  Panthers had reverted to their back-3 formation with 5 across the middle to counter the always strong El Diego centre midfield and it was paying dividends.  Sho and Tom were causing them problems up front and forced a string of corners.  Matt Lennon put over a pin-point delivery and only Ma will know how he missed a golden opportunity to head home at the near post.  The writing was on the wall though and a few minutes later, Ben Cordier stole in to glance a header into the bottom corner, 1-0 Panthers. <br>
							<br>
							The rain had been belting down non-stop and with about 20 minutes gone, the first signs of standing water began to appear.  Not to worry, this was an &ldquo;all weather&rdquo; pitch, right?    Undeterred, both teams continued to play good football with El Diego coming increasingly into the game.  A dangerous burst by the classy El Diego  midfield maestro was brought to a shuddering halt on the edge of Panther's box, by a great tackle from Rick.  The ref saw it differently, and awarded a free kick.  A great curling free kick hit the inside of the post before being cleared away but, the first warning signs had been posted.  A few minutes later, a long ball  found El Diego's forward, and simultaneously, Matt's &ldquo;clean 'em out&rdquo; tackle.  Miraculously, the forward stayed on his feet, retrieved the ball and floated a great finish into the far corner, 1-1, and so it stayed to half time.  <br>
							<br>
							Wisely, given the dreadful conditions, the ref turned the players straight round and kicked off the 2nd half.  By this stage, there was standing water over wide areas of the pitch.  Slick one-touch football had given way to a churning, splashing, surfing, battle of attrition.  A classic duel of British grit and determination against Japanese.........well, grit and determination, actually.  Both teams really wanted it, but the tide was definitely in the Panthers favour.  Waves of attacks were being repelled by last ditch defending from El Diego with all hands to the pumps.  Sho looked to have won it with a neat finish but the ball came off the post and ran agonizingly along the goal line before being cleared to safety.  Just when it looked like it wasn't to be our day, a cross from Sho found its way to Dan Clark at the far stick and, shrugging off the effects of acute hypothermea, he finished with aplomb.  2-1 Panthers.<br>
							<br>
							There were some nervous moments towards the end of the game as El Diego pressed for the equalizer, but the defence, marshalled by Matty, stood firm.  Sid came to the rescue with a great save late on, but the Panthers were not to be denied and bagged another victory to cement their lead at the top of div 2.  Great performance from Lars in defence and some cameos at the end from Kei and Alan, saw the team home.  Just a word for the referee, who was excellent (again).  You could say, he kept the game flowing!<br>
