						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 25th April.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>&quot;The best teams win continuously, the rest don't.&quot;</b> That was the message before kickoff from Sala's captain, Guido.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Sala are definetely in the latter category.&nbsp; After bossing YCAC on their home turf last week, they just couldn't grab all 3 points&nbsp;against Lions, despite dominating possession and chances, so this one finished in a draw.&nbsp; With a solo run and deflected shot from Abu of&nbsp;Lions and a solitary, but quality, equaliser from Toby the points were shared as the game finished&nbsp;1-1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sala started sluggishly but still managed to fashion numerous chances in the first 10 minutes.&nbsp; First, Scotty forced a fine save from Orlando, after some great work from Sam down the left.&nbsp; Sam, then skinned two defenders again before committing Orlando and touching the ball off to Toby.&nbsp; With the goal at his mercy, he didn't get over the ball enough, and watched in horror&nbsp;as it clipped the top of the bar.&nbsp; Ryotarou was next to torment the Lions' left flank, twisting their Japanese fullback inside out, then driving into the box where his heels were clipped and he was brought down for a penalty.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Lenny stepped up to take his second spot kick in a week.&nbsp; He chose the same corner but didn't hit it as sweetly as before.&nbsp; This was crucial.&nbsp; Especially, with Orlando having refereed Sala's last game.&nbsp; It gave him the&nbsp;advantage he needed.&nbsp; Flying to his left he pulled off a lovely save to deny the Kiwi left footer.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							By this point Sala could have been 3-0 to the good, but&nbsp;they weren't, and things soon got worse when the Lions scored on&nbsp;the counter.&nbsp; The Lions&nbsp;had always looked dangerous, if&nbsp;a little disjointed, with Fahad and&nbsp;their no.11&nbsp;doing most of their best work.&nbsp; However, it was&nbsp;Somi and Abu who combined for the goal.&nbsp; Somi,&nbsp;controlled a goal kick and passed to Abu, who had been quiet up to that point,&nbsp;and he went on a&nbsp;typical solo run upfield.&nbsp; Having&nbsp;made space for himself well in the box, his shot&nbsp;deflected off Guido's hip and sneaked into the bottom corner of the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;1-0 Lions.&nbsp; Lions were definetely lucky to be ahead, but who ever said football was fair?<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The goal, against the run of play, and&nbsp;Sala's missed chances, seemed to deflate them for the remainder of the half, and a&nbsp;Toby header from Take's cross, and a&nbsp;half volley from Scotty were the only&nbsp;attempts they could muster in reply.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The second half was a bizarre one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sala&nbsp;totally dominated.&nbsp; However, they&nbsp;only scored once, and in the end Lions could have&nbsp;stolen&nbsp;all 3 points&nbsp;at the death.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							First, Lenny hit a free kick off the bar which rebounded to Sam.&nbsp; The rebound was too quick though, and he put an&nbsp;instinctive header wide of&nbsp;an open goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shige then threatened with a couple of long range shots before Sala got their just desserts.&nbsp; Scotty received the ball from&nbsp;Guido then played it in to Toby's feet.&nbsp; Toby's first touch was class, and it&nbsp;made enough room for him to let rip from twenty yards finding the bottom corner of the net in style.&nbsp;&nbsp;1-1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sala immediately&nbsp;started pushing&nbsp;for the winner, and with Ian, Guido and Lenny winning everything in the air at the back, it looked like they would get it.&nbsp; The game was all one way traffic towards the Lions' goal.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;Sala had their chances, but they possibly tried too hard and showed a lack of composure in the final third.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is possibly the difference between being a title contender and an also ran.&nbsp; Ryotarou was first to snatch at a shot, driving it into Orlando's arms before Scotty and Shige both fired wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Towards the end, Lions had their solitary chance to complete what would have been a smash and grab victory.&nbsp; Lenny was dispossessed in his own half, giving Lions a 3 vs 2 opportunity.&nbsp; Lions worked it well and set up their extra man, Yuki, for a side footed finish.&nbsp; He struck his shot well, but&nbsp;Taylor was down in a flash bringing out the save of the match,&nbsp; Simply because he had hardly anything else to do.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Lo and behold though,&nbsp;there was still another twist in the slithering football tale.&nbsp; Breaking from the back, Dan released Sam who charged relentlessly down the wing (could any defender stop him in full flight?)&nbsp;and cut the ball&nbsp;back to Shige.&nbsp; His&nbsp;shot was parried by Orlando, the&nbsp;rebound was tucked away by Scotty, but it was chopped off for offside.&nbsp; Harsh indeed but fair in truth, although not by&nbsp;7 yards!&nbsp; Merely by a Lions' whisker.&nbsp; 1-1 Final Score.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Man of the Match</b> - Ian.&nbsp; Didn't put a foot wrong.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Sinner of the Match</b> - All TML teams that had a good start to the season.<br>
