						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 6th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							With the first half almost ending in farce and the second half ending more like a training match this was never a game for the purists. The 4-0 scoreline probably does do justice to BFC's dominance of the game but in fairness to Lions they battled well in defence and kept trying to take the game to BFC even when a few goals behind.<br>
							<br>
							For the first time this year, BFC had the luxury of almost putting out a full squad -&nbsp;and it showed. With Carlos and Shota pulling the midfield strings and BFC hard-man Kazu making a welcome return to the centre there were always going to be chances. The first came from a cross from the left, unusually misjudged by Lions' rock Orlando only for Jon Day to pop up at the back post and shoulder it home.&nbsp;Day said&nbsp;shoulder, Lions did, and doubtless still do, disagree. 1-0 BFC.<br>
							<br>
							There was nothing controversial about the second. Sho set off on one of his runs and having skipped around the obligatory couple of players went route 1 as Jon Day's clever run created some space just outside the box. Sho wasted no time exploiting that space and smashed a great strike home from distance. The Rock had no chance. 2-0 BFC.<br>
							<br>
							It seems no Lions BFC game is complete without a bit of controversy and so it was to prove. A decent BFC move ended when Carlos calmly slipped a ball across the box to the unmarked Sho to slot home - a bread and butter pass for a bread and butter finish. Some time later a flag goes up but the ref rightly allows the goal. Then all hell broke loose. Once the dust settled and the handbag straps had been cleared from the turf it was hard to see how at 3-0 down Lions could get back into the game, especially as their 12th man had ditched the flag and walked off in disgust. All credit to Charlie and Orlando for getting the game back though was it really worth it....<br>
							<br>
							The second half was as forgettable a half of football as you're ever likely to see. With half an eye on Dr Phil 'Daddy' Lowes MBA's farewell bash and with the beer swilling Vags supporting from the sidelines, the game was played out at half pace by BFC with only one goal to show&nbsp;despite most of the&nbsp;possession. It was delivered by Carlos from distance, courtesy of a clever dummy by Evans. 4-0 BFC the final scoreline.<br>
