									TML players expect it all these days, flash cars, pop star girlfriends, onigiris and lined pitches. The Swiss literally laid down a marker by putting the Panthers to shame in the pitch marking stakes. <br>

The low hanging cloud like a pool of stale smoke over a late-night poker game and a breeze from the north made for ideal conditions to play the beautiful game.<br>
									As 11.30am struck, the teams lined up ready to begin the contest. Yabe F.C. wearing white faced King George F.C. in orange. Both teams looked confident, although King George were without the drunken Adam &lsquo;Teenwolf&rsquo; McCann and the influential Tomoki &lsquo;Terminator&rsquo; Shiota who was called away to the United States of A at the last minute. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season7/0927kgfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Saitama Jets engaged in a well fought, well mannered game versus Division I newcomers, Zion FC. The game started with both teams struggling to fill their starting 11, with Zion starting with only 10 men. The Jets quickly turned to the attack (although most of them probably didn&rsquo;t realize they were playing against an under-strength team) and had a few chances in the opening 10 minutes. Veteran Sasaki coolly converted a flick-on by newbie Andrew via the Delap like long throw of John &ldquo;Wildebeest&rdquo; Rayner.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season7/0919jets.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
