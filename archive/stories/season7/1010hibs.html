						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 10th October.</b><br>
							If a good football game is like a fine wine, then Saturday's match between Hibs and Gecks was a decanter of Saizeriya red. Lacking in taste and character perhaps, but with plenty of zing for your yen.<br>
							<br>
							Both sides had struggled for players and a lot of the warm-up was light-hearted handshakes and banter, but with the opening whistle the atmosphere went serious. These two teams really don't like each other very much, and with the Ghost of Colless hovering over the pitch a rocky match was underway.<br>
							<br>
							Geckoes had the best of the early play, pouring forward down the wings of an ad hoc Hibs defense. An early effort from the right went just wide, as did a shot off of a long run down the left, before they scored first with a close, unchallenged blast that left Hitoshi no chance _ 1-0 to the reptiles. That woke the Hibs up a bit, and we had a few chances of our own, the best a McGirr shot off the crossbar, but no love.<br>
							<br>
							In the second it was all Hibs as we found space on the giant Fukuda Denshi pitch and worked the ball around. Keita chipped a charging McGirr though, who calmly lobbed to tie, then the Mighty O got in, hit the keeper with his attempt but gathered the rebound and calmly finished. Andre, who is getting that look in his eyes again, took a long pass from the back, rounded his man and slotted it home, then pounced on a dropped ball in the box to flick home for his second as the game ended, 4-1 to Hibs.<br>
							<br>
							Not pretty, but we'll take it. The game was chippy throughout and the ref did a good job for having no linesmen. As it was a Geckoes match, Bevan was given an honorary red card after the game.<br>
