						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 7th November.</b><br>
							I think a neutral would say a draw would've been a fair result. I'm not neutral and think a BFC win was deserved. A missed PK, a blatant PK disallowed, the usual array of quality saves and sweeping by Hitoshi in the Hibs' goal and the final whistle goes after Sho is fouled on the edge of the Hibs' box...free kick...? Apparently not, final whistle. Sour grapes? Maybe.<br>
							<br>
							In fairness to Hibs, they played their usual tight passing game with pretty much everything good they did (which was plenty) being channeld through McGirr, who for my money was the best player on the day - Shosuke comes close mind while Carlos' passing remains in a different class to anyone else in TML. <br>
							<br>
							0-0 going into half time and Hibs were the happier of the sides with their cumbersome defence not looking like a side who had only conceded a handful going into this fixture, then again that's all about Hitoshi. The BFC team talk was all about patience and it will come. Unfortuantely, it came when BFC's Taichi was fouled in the middle of the park. All stop expecting a foul. Foul not given. Flat footed BFC defence the suddenly caught out as the likeable Andre Pinto did what he does best and ran onto a little dink of a ball and calmly slotted past Tepi:<br>
							<br>
							<b>1-0 Hibs.</b> <br>
							<br>
							Then Shosuke did what he does best, making a monkey of one of the Hibs' defenders (for about the 'nth time in the game) to draw a fair PK. The defender who committed the foul knew it was one, though readers will not be surprised to know a couple of Hibs' players disagreed. Nobody needs me to say who they are and the sort of behaviour that followed.......do you? An incident followed. Usual suspects. Every league needs it Robbie Savages, it's what makes the Premiership so exciting. We'll say no more. With Hotoshi going the wrong way, the PK is missed.<br>
							<br>
							With time against BFC they stream forward in numbers only for Hibs to snatch a second on the break. Great first save from Tepi ends up being palmed into the feet of a Hibs' player for an easy tap in. With 15 mins left BFC had plenty of possession but it wasn't to be. A late consolation goal from Evans would've left for a tense finale but there were only seconds left on the clock when he scored and no time to get the equaliser.<br>
							<br>
							BFC will bounce back, the Hibs march on.<br>
