						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 25th April.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							After a hectic week in Hong Kong, and lack of sleep, the last thing I wanted was to find myself playing a full game in central defence due to having only 12 players against a strong Sala line-up, on the high after beating last year&rsquo;s champs, and against us, after losing badly to Hibs with 8 players!<br>
							However, whenever Lions show up an hour before the game, and with the oldies (like your truly) are forced to play....commitment shows, and we Lions play our hearts out.<br>
							We went into the game with a keeper, &nbsp;3 defenders, and 8 midfielders! No strikers on the day!...And to make things worse, a guest player, and the source of flair &#150; Abu, was injured and had to play to complete the 11.<br>
							Sala started strongly, and a their fast striker (no.17 playing alongside Toby...dont know his name, so for now will call him Toby 2)...cut in past Yuki on the left wing, and as I poked the ball from him and tried to shoulder him off, he still put a shot in from 8 yards out, only to hit the cross bar!<br>
							Minutes later the Japanese left winger for Sala cut across Yuki, whose challenge did get the ball, but ref decided he got the player too, and a penalty was awarded.<br>
							Lenny stepped up and as he hit the ball towards the top left of Orlando.....Spiderman pulled a brilliant save, pushing the ball away to a corner!..It was so beautiful I was tempted to make another penalty to see that save again ;)<br>
							Sala&rsquo;s corners were dangerous, but so were Lions corners.<br>
							Despite Lions playing 4-3-3, Captain Somi seemed isolated upfront, and we kept playing the counter attack....and as Somi controlled a long kick from Orlando....he carried the ball a few yards before passing it to the surprisingly quiet (and injured) Abu, who used his trickery to move, stop, turn, and hit a sweet ball from a tight angle between Taylor and the post to give Lions the lead at half time.<br>
							Second half started badly with Sima&rsquo;s error letting Toby2 in, but my block from his shot from 7 yards out probably denied him a goal. Worse news was when Sima (centre-back) pulled his hamstring again, and Lions had to push Fahad back in defence and introduce Aziz in midfield.<br>
							This change invite Sala more into Lions territory as Fahad was controlling the midfield well.<br>
							Sala then had a free-kick that rebound off the bar only for Toby2 to head it wide from 5 yards out (but was too high for him).<br>
							Sala kept pushing, and a few neat passes say Toby take a low shot from the &lsquo;D&rsquo;, a milli-second before I got to him.....finding the bottom left corner of the goal to equalise for Sala.<br>
							A few minutes later Sala had a good long shot that Orlando parried onto the path of a Sala player who put it in the net, but was clearly offside...maybe 7 yards or so...and there was no complaints when it was fairly ruled out.<br>
							Moments later, the right-back Yuki for Lions found himself 15 yards out, with a deflected ball, and he hit a sweet low shot that would&rsquo;ve put Lions ahead, only for Taylor to pull a remarkable save to push it agonizingly wide for a corner.<br>
							In the last second of the game, Abu went past 2 players and instead of taking the shot, he rightfully passed a perfect ball to his younger brother Omar on the left, 6 yards out, onside, but hit the ball as he&rsquo;s leaning back, sending it 2 metres above the bar and saving Sala&rsquo;s blushes!<br>
							Had there been any other keeper than Orlando and Taylor, it would&rsquo;ve been 2-2 at least...hats off to both keepers!<br>
							Overall entertaining game, well refereed too.<br>
							Lions still struggling for consistency since winning Division 2, but at least this time gauranteed safety with 3 games to go, and maintained a new unbeaten record this season against teams like Sala.<br>
							Lenny was a rock in defence for Sala, and the tall chap with curly hair played really well in midfield.<br>
							Toby and Toby2 &#150; the Double Trouble - made us work really hard in defence.....great players....and it felt like playing against 2xSpeedy Gonzales! but I have to be biased and give Man of the match to a Lions player...<br>
							Fahad was briliant and I gave him Man of the Match a few times, but this time I saved this for a brilliant player, recently added to Lions...committed, plays everywhere, and plays his heart out.....and above all his motivational words throughout the game make it a pleasure playing with him.....the skilful, hardworking midfielder, who played in an unorthodox left back position and did&rsquo;nt do a single mistake.....so....without further ado, my Man of the Match: Keishi Mitsuda<br>
							(Just found Toby2 on team pic...Sam Mathews...but I like Toby2 for now :)<br>
