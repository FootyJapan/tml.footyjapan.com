									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 13th September</b><br>
										The Jets 2nds ended last season 2nd from bottom of the 3rd division, ranking them a lowly 29th out of the TML's 30 teams. The men from Saitama seem intent on improving that standing, and a 3-1 victory over a combative Clash side sees them with&nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;maximum 6 points from 2 games so far. Nate Gildart can be particularly happy with himself, as he improved on last week's brace to score his first league hat-trick since&nbsp;his big-money move from Aomori 5 years ago.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game was a decent battle, with the Clash showing all the guile you would expect from a team recently playing in the second division. In the first half, the Jets had the better of the chances, and managed to rattle&nbsp;the Clash woodwork 3 or 4 times. Garner was first, connecting with his head to a good Hayashi corner, only to see the header flick off the the bar. Rayner then repeated the trick, this time with a long,&nbsp; &nbsp;languid, loopy header from Garner's cross, which again bounced off the bar. Randy Harada then picked up the pieces from a corner, only to see his volley beat the keeper, but once more not the crossbar. It wasn't all Jets in the first half, but the Clash game plan seemed to be to win throw-ins on the left&nbsp;side and launch&nbsp;missiles, Delap-like, towards the Jets goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean Kingsbeer, back from his loan period with King George, was big enough and loud enough to regularly clear most of the debris in his box.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>The first goal, when it came, was a touch controversial. Garner again wandered out of position to the left wing, from where he launched a cross towards Gildart at the back post. Nate attempted to jump, but the presence of a large defender on his back made it somewhat tricky to do so. We appealed, Paul the ref dutifully awarded the penalty,&nbsp;and Nate&nbsp;expertly dispatched it. It was definitely a foul, it was just one of those that don't often get given in the box, hence the confusion from the Clash. The Clash made a few changes, including the addition of Rafa, who is clearly&nbsp;WAY too fast to be allowed to play in Division 3. This should be raised at the AGM next year. Andy Welch also joined the game, and these two additions helped the Clash&nbsp;attack with a bit more venom. &nbsp;Just as the Clash started getting back into the game, though, Gildart struck again. A ball was played down the Jets left wing, Clash defender and keeper got in a bit of a muddle, and the Jets striker was left to pick up the pieces and place the ball into an empty net. The Jets looked to go into the half with a comfortable 2-0 lead, but then pressed their own self-destruct button. Comedy defending on the left-hand side let the spritely Clash forward advance unchallenged, and he finished coolly from around the edge of the box. Kingsbeer was left momentarily crying into his beer.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Much of the same in the second half. The Clash looked dangerous with their reinforcements, but Rayner and co mostly won the midfield battle for the Jets. Rafa's mazy run along the goal-line seemed to have resulted in an own-goal, until the ref pointed out that the ball was 6 feet or so out of play at one point. Clash felt hard done by, the Jets thanked Paul's Mum for feeding him carrots when he was a nipper. The third and decisive goal came after good work on the right from the pied Piper, whose cross (shot?) evaded the hardworking Fraser Gould and landed at the feet of Gildart. He didn't waste&nbsp;the chance to complete his hat-trick. Piper went close himself with a good volley after&nbsp;being set up by Dez Bliss and Hayashi also fizzed an effort just wide. Right at the last, a good Clash effort forced a decent save from the Jets' Kingsbeer, but that was the last piece of meaningful action.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										3-1 to the Jets, who next week test themselves against a handy-looking Shane side.<br>
