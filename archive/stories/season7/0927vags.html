									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 27th September</b><br>
										The vagabonds made it two wins on the trot/bounce/spin, whatever you&nbsp;prefer, overcoming the Barbarians by 3 goals to&nbsp;2 at Hachioji koen. Taking to the field in a kit that smelled of cats urine the vagabonds dominated the first half in terms of posession and territory and at times played some splendid link-up&nbsp;football. Garry Robertson - the poor man's Steve Glenn- was imperious at the back mopping up any danger that came our way. Going forward, Graham Burt was always available at right back and Nao, Ian, Phil,&nbsp;Muzzy&nbsp;and especially Takuma were putting the Barbarians defence under extreme pressure.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The breakthrough came after about 30 mins when Lyndsey - the vags player most able to secure a patent for his run with Monty Python's ministry of silly walks - delivered a pinpoint corner for Nao to nod home from point blank range. All&nbsp;was going pretty well and so some of the Barbarians were looking bemused as the vags gave a fairly negative half time team talk in full earshot.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first&nbsp;20 minutes&nbsp;of the 2nd half went like&nbsp;a dream&nbsp;for the vags.&nbsp;The&nbsp;game was pretty much decided after Richard Straughan's 'inspired substitutions' bringing on Matt and Amos. In fairness though the phrase&nbsp;&nbsp;'inspired substitutions' is just some bollocks made up by commentator twats like Clive Tydlesley&nbsp;and the fact is that both Amos and Matt had to come on then or they wouldn't have had a game. Anyway they did well, Matt, who seems to be scoring for fun at the moment (another stupid cliche that, what else would he score for? indifference? world peace?), made&nbsp;it 2-0 with a header from close range before Muzzy made it 3 with a fine finish after a smart&nbsp;move that involved 4&nbsp;vags players.<br>
										Game over? Unfortunately not, there's&nbsp;more chance of finding a clean sheet in a love hotel than there is with the vags, and so a 3-0 walk in the park turned into 3-2 with the battling Barbarians scoring a good first goal and then&nbsp;taking advantage of some sloppy defensive play to pile the pressure back on the vags. The grandstand finish never materialised, the two goals&nbsp;proved to be just&nbsp;a consolation for the Barbarians (who didn't actually look that consoled, in fact have any of you ever&nbsp;felt consoled by a 'consolation goal'?)&nbsp;though, as the vags stepped up a gear and saw the last 10 minutes or so out with&nbsp;comfort and should really have added to their&nbsp;tally.<br>
										A&nbsp;very good&nbsp;performance from the vags, who will look forward to welcoming back&nbsp;arguably their 3 best players&nbsp;in&nbsp;Steve Glenn, Paul Wadsworth and&nbsp;Japan's 7th most eligible bachelor as well as our prolific match reporter garry quinn, which all&nbsp;bodes well for the coming matches and match reports of the tml season. UP THE VAGS.<br>
