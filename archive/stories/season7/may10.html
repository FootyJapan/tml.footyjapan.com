								<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, May 22nd, 2010</b>.<br>
									It was a nice season for the Swiss: A sweet winning streak that brought promotion to Division 1, good performances in the New Year's and Charity 7's and a great turnout of players for the games. The plate would be the icing on the cake: Not the most prestigious title, but a title nonetheless.<br>
									<br>
									The opposition in the final were the Jet 2nds, a team that is still in the run for promotion to the second division and looked like a stronger oppostion than their first team in the semi-final. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/archive/stories/0910/0522platefinal.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

									<br>
									It didn't look good early, BFC were loose and annoyingly confident. A bad call on the formation plus nerves didn't help, and the Brits were all over us. . <a class="txlink" href="0522hibs.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

									&nbsp;<br>
									KFC Tokyo, organized by former TML Swiss Kickers Captain Kirk Neureiter went all the way walking away with the prestige cup in over 35 competitions.<br>
									The team consisted of 7 nationalities, Kirk shut down opponents best strikers, who teamed up with ex-professional Frenchman Frederic Rault and Hibs/Swiss TML great Rafael De Marchi in defense. Midfield was manned by Scotsman Martin Tierney, Malaysians Puva and Kuru, TML Swiss player Takahisa Suzuki, and Jason Bailey. Striker was an eventual competition MVP David Serene, also an ex-pro, who was simply unstoppable all day. Hitoshi in goal was impressed what he had in front of him, it made his job rather easy. <a class="txlink" href="0515HK7s.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>

									BFC put out their youngest side in many years with more under 30s playing than over 30s, but it was the over 30s who probably edged the battle of the BFC generations with an aging back line (average age closer to 40 than 30) keeping a deserved clean sheet and with Day and Himmer (we won't go there) both coming back from injury to show typical composure in their play <a class="txlink" href="0501bfc.html" target="_blank">more...</a><br>
