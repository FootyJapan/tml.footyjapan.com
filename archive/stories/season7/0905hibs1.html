									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 5th September</b><br>
										For two years now there has been a persistant&nbsp;buzz around the TML.&nbsp; What started as little more than a whisper, the beating of an aural&nbsp;butterfly's wings&nbsp;from the depths of the then newly formed TML division three, has steadily grown over the past two years into a furious, omniprescent thunderous roar.&nbsp; The noise is words.&nbsp; The words a question.&nbsp; The question: <b>Are FC International any good?</b>&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The broken, battered, eviscerated shells of the teams that stood futiley in the path of the International juggernaut like&nbsp;a lone protestor&nbsp;in Tiananmen square&nbsp;would perhaps testify that The 'national are quite handy.&nbsp; Some of their members would let it be known that they're more than handy.&nbsp; But, but...&nbsp; Doubts remained.&nbsp; Last season they played two teams from the middle order of TML division one and were victorious in neither game.&nbsp; Perhaps they were nothing more than flat track bully's?&nbsp; Able to assert their mastery over the weaker teams but up against craggy, experienced TML one-ers they would be found out as talkers of the talk but limpers of the walk.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The day of destiny, Judgement day was set for 5th September (International's first div one game was actually the week prior but it was against Zion -the side that came up from div 2 with the Inters but who were turned over by t'national twice and finished a whopping 23 points behind them- so doesn't count).&nbsp; Hibs Vs Fc International.&nbsp; Representing the old money: Hibs one of, if not&nbsp;the top sides in TML.&nbsp; Twice div one champions, twice div one runners up and once Footy Japan cup winners.&nbsp; Representing the new: FC International.&nbsp; Runaway winners of division's three and two over the past two season's.&nbsp; Who would come out on top?&nbsp; Who would walk away tails between legs, ego's shredded, faces stained with tears?<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Well, neither to be honest.&nbsp; As in all 'big' match, er, match ups the actual event couldn't live up to the hype. Think Barcelona vs Man utd in the champions league final last year.&nbsp; Think of pretty much any big match, ever.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So, the game.&nbsp; A classic example of that hoariest of cliches, a game of two halves.&nbsp; The fisrt was F.C Inter's.&nbsp; Those experienced in the ways of the game always knew that this was a game where mastery of the midfield would be key.&nbsp; Whoever held sway in the middle would carry the day.&nbsp; In the first 40 minues it was International who commanded the centre of the park.&nbsp; Their slick passing and quick, intelligent &nbsp;movement enabled them to outmanouevre and cut through the Hibs midfield.&nbsp;&nbsp; Space could be found down Hibs's flanks and on occasion in the centre.&nbsp; And if there's one thing you don't want to give the prolific Squeaky Ohno!(copywrite:Albion oldboys) its space in the box as his 30 goals last season are no doubt testament to.&nbsp; As the first half entered it's second half FC International floated a ball into Hibs's box.&nbsp; It sailed&nbsp;tormentingly&nbsp;over the out of positioned heads of Jay and McKenna and found the unmarked Sukui Ono in line with the back stick, 7 or 8 yards out from the goal.&nbsp; He planted his header back across Hitoshi and that was his third goal of the season taken care of.&nbsp; Easy.&nbsp; And deserved.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Luckily for Hibs, International despite their lions share of possesion didn't carve out too many other clear cut chances in the first half.&nbsp; The lead could have been double if it had not been for the quick feet of McKenna.&nbsp; A rare Hitoshi error allowed International to get a (weak) shot off at the unguarded Hibs goal.&nbsp; Fortunately McKenna was alive to the danger and was able to scamper back and clear off the line.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Infact it was hibs who had the only other really noteworthy chance infront of goal.&nbsp; The effervescent Tomo found himself unmarked, four yards out from the 'nationals goal with a ball delievered on a plate, no,on a&nbsp;silver platter, to his head.&nbsp; Tomo, being a well trained player knows that all strikers should head the ball downwards.&nbsp; Which is what he did.&nbsp; A little to downwards it turned out as the ball thwacked into the 3g turf and bounced high over the crossbar.&nbsp; If there is a footballing purgatory Tomo's going to find himself in a room with Ronny Rhosenthal.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>So 1-0 F.C International at the break.</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half.&nbsp; Hibs's half.&nbsp; The introduction of&nbsp;Calla to the rearguard brought about some much needed stability at the back.&nbsp; Signed as a striker, his impressive marshalling of the backline suggests he might be playing more games in defense than in the forward line. The midfield began to get to grips with international's passing and moving and were able to assert themselves more and more as the half wore on.&nbsp; Josh snapped in the tackles, McGirr probed with his passing and the mercurial Tomo floated like an Ali-esque butterfly.&nbsp; Up top, despite lacking match fitness and sharpness, Pinto huffed and puffed like a big bad wolf but was unable to open his account for the season.&nbsp; The game looked like it had a second goal in it, but for who?&nbsp; FC International despite conceding the impetus in the second half were still able to carve out a couple of decent openings.&nbsp; It took several fantastic trademark Hitoshi saves to keep the boy s in green in it.&nbsp; So if hibs weren't going to concede the second goal they'd have to score it.&nbsp; Which they duly did.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Tomo was brought down on the right handside of t'inters box.&nbsp; McGirr territory.&nbsp; The second best left foot in the TML whipped in the free kick.&nbsp; Was it a shot?&nbsp; Was it a cross?&nbsp; Whatever it was it found its way to Jay's head which did what Tomo's couldn't and put the ball in the back of the net.&nbsp; 1-1.&nbsp; Game on.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										No hotly contested TML div one&nbsp;game can finish without a bit of argy bargy.&nbsp; Hibs Inter... was no different.&nbsp; Down in the corner Hibs hardman McGirr and F.C I... player Chopper Someone tussled for the ball.&nbsp; The tussle became a push&nbsp;the push&nbsp;a squaring up.&nbsp; No Marquess of Quensberry this time though but enough handbagging for the ref to brandish two yellow cards, and briefly one red thanks to Josh's cheeky intervention.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The final whistle brought to an end an evenly contested and scored game.&nbsp; It also brought us a littler closer to answering the F.C International question.&nbsp; <b>Are they any good?&nbsp; Simply put, yes</b>.&nbsp; They're a decent side who are going to cause any team they play trouble.&nbsp; Expect them to join the ranks of Hibs, YCAC and BFC as one of the teams to beat.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>Man of Match: Hitoshi.&nbsp; Great saves.&nbsp; Again</b>.<br>
