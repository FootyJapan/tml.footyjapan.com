							Although it is too early in the season to read too much into league positions, YCAC&nbsp;2`s versus Panthers pitched the&nbsp;undefeated league leaders against a YCAC team yet to get off the mark.&nbsp; And a good&nbsp;game it turned out to be - 5 goals, 2 red cards,&nbsp;and 1 controversial winner in extra time.&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							Panthers were on top for the first 20 and must have been left scratching their heads at being&nbsp;2 goals down at the end of the first quarter.&nbsp; Classic counter-attacking and a bit of hesitation in the Panthers defence led to&nbsp;goals from Neil Shonhard and Matt Wallace, I think in both cases&nbsp;following great forward play from Andy Chambers.&nbsp; Towards the end of the 2nd half Panthers did what they had been trying to do&nbsp;all game - free their quick no 9 with a through ball over the top, who finished very neatly.<br>
							<br>
							<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/1011ycacvpan3.JPG" alt="" height="233" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">The referee whistled for the end of the 1st half early - and was persuaded after some difficulty that he hadn`t played the required 40 minutes.&nbsp; The teams then came back on and after some minutes of play the referee blew again for half-time.&nbsp; Cue mass protestations from Panthers, following which the referee seemed inclined to&nbsp;RE-re-start the 1st half.&nbsp; YCAC were&nbsp;not happy&nbsp;to&nbsp;re-start again, rightly thinking that this was becoming something of a farce.&nbsp; Many things in life are negotiable, but I don`t think the referees timekeeping should be&nbsp;(unless you are SAF).&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhoo,&nbsp;it would then appear that the referee had decided to add some time on to the 2nd half, but exactly&nbsp;how much time and who from the YCAC had been informed of this decision&nbsp;seems extremely cloudy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							Having been subbed at half-time your author was then given the flag for the 2nd half.&nbsp; Play kicked off at 10.58 - I made a&nbsp;note of it and even checked with a Panthers sub that he agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Panthers continued to press for an equaliser but Danny&nbsp;Rawlings&nbsp;&nbsp;in goal and the defence marshalled by Simon Carden&nbsp;contrived to keep them out for 30 minutes or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;YCAC`s Karle Hahne had one good opportunity to increase our lead - made great contact but unfortuanely blazed over&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
							<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/1011ycacvpan2.JPG" alt="" height="267" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">But&nbsp;Panthers pressure&nbsp;was beginning to tell and when their striker was given space to line up a shot from 25 yards&nbsp;it flew into the top corner.&nbsp; Great goal.&nbsp; The&nbsp;two red cards which followed shortly afterwards were a wee bit harsh I felt - just a bit of a coming together between centre-half and centre-forward, a couple of yellows might have been more appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;extra space generated by the removal of 2 players definitely helped&nbsp;Panthers more as the younger and fitter team.&nbsp;<br>
							<br>
							And it was pretty obvious that a winner was on the cards as YCAC tended to sit back - but did it have to come in the 46th minute of the 2nd half?&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly how long did the whole match last for?&nbsp; Not sure anyone really knew, but it was certainly closer to 85 minutes than 80 -&nbsp;no doubt the referee wanted to err on the side of caution after the&nbsp;1st half&nbsp;and ended up over-compensating.<br>
							<br>
							However enough clock-watching -&nbsp;additional time added on inevitably favours&nbsp;the attacking side and that is what happened.&nbsp; We`d prefer to take away the&nbsp;positives - best performance so far this season from YCAC 2nds,&nbsp;a&nbsp;great&nbsp;team effort which on any other day will produce points.<br>
