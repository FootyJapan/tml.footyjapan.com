						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 7th November.</b><br>
							History was created tonight as a Kanto Celt, yes a Kanto Celt, upon scoring the crucial third goal which killed the game as a contest, turned away to do a cartwheel into a back somersault! Yes dear readers, there were many witnesses present. Well done Matthew. Put Robbie Keane&rsquo;s front rolls to shame.<br>
							<br>
							Sala will probably feel hard done by the result, particularly the score line. Although Celts went in at half time 1-0 up, SALA started sharper, were more comfortable on the ball, and their striker missed two glorious chances when it seemed harder to miss. <br>
							<br>
							A Hair dryer was applied at half time in the Celts camp, to one individual in particular, and he responded in the best possible way to anchor a much changed Celts team in the second half.&nbsp; For fear of bias, here are the goals as described by Sam manager:<br>
							<br>
							&nbsp;&ldquo;<b>1st goal</b>, Mathew taking the ball of Sala on the right wing, finding Peter who crossed for Jo to get in front of his defender and guide the ball past the keeper. <br>
							<b>2nd goal</b>, a blatant foul on Wataru the referee didn&rsquo;t blow up for, looked like Sala went to sleep thinking the ref was going to blow up for the foul, loose ball fell to Peter who lobbed the keeper from 30 yards out. <br>
							<b>3rd goal</b>, a long clearance out of defence, Sala defender miscontrolled and handballed on the edge of the box, Peter stepped up and thought about curling it around the wall, but instead passed the ball to Mathew on the edge of the wall, Mathew turned and placed the ball past the out rushing keeper. Cheeky! <br>
							<b>4th goal</b> &#150; corner from Jo from the left side, H in front of the defender and headed the ball back across the face of the goal and into the corner (H might remember it differently)!&rdquo;<br>
							The Celts in the second half, while not exactly dominating possession, were much more solid at the back, and SALA were forced to shoot from range. Aki was equal to all bar one, well put away by Peter Swinney.&nbsp; In front of goal the Celts took their chances well. New debutants Andrew and Ichiro slotted in very well, and the Celts extended their winning run to four. Whatever the hoops do this season, I&rsquo;d like to see anyone else better the somersault.<br>
