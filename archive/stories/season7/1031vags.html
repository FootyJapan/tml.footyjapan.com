						<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 31st October.</b><br>
							<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/1031vags2.jpg" alt="" height="228" width="250" align="right" border="0" hspace="5">
							The first thing that comes to mind on meeting the Panthers this season is &lsquo;what is the opposite of &lsquo;pretty in pink&rsquo; because their kit just begs the question&#x2026;<br>
							<br>
							But, despite the look, we had also had a glance at the league table beforehand and in addition were greeted with the strange sight of a division two team actually taking a warm up seriously. (Or just actually warming up&#x2026;which is the same thing really.) Phil Lowes is definitely finding life tough in the second division as his talk of &lsquo;come on now let&rsquo;s get together and do some stretching&rsquo;&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;..was greeted with the usual &lsquo;I&rsquo;m off for a poo&rsquo;&#x2026;&rsquo;phone just rang&rsquo;&#x2026;&rsquo;look at those crows shagging&rsquo;&#x2026;.(at least 5 dragged away), and the fact that Sid turned up in an orangey top looking silly didn&rsquo;t help either. So, admitted, &#150; Vags pre match concentration level is not all it could be. <br>
							Darren did have some sage advice in the pre-match team talk and for a nano second or so we were focused&#x2026;but then a plane flew over from Haneda and 14 sets of eyes went upwards.<br>
							<br>
							Then the game kicked off and the Vags that are today&rsquo;s model were very focused indeed and very into it. Muzzy chased down a ball after about 10 mins and despite the claims from the defender that the ball had gone out &#150; Muzzy hassled, dispossessed yer man, cut in from the touchline and passed it by the keeper with (can I say it about someone from Manchester?) nonchalance. Bingo. There was some controversy about whether the ball had gone out for a throw but from where I was stood, 70 yards away on the opposite side of the pitch, the ball was definitely in&#x2026;.anyway their linesman didn&rsquo;t put his flag up and he was three yards away&#x2026;.anyway Muzzy said it was in and he wouldn&rsquo;t lie would he? He&rsquo;s a nice lad.<br>
							<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/1031vags3.jpg" alt="" height="218" width="250" align="left" border="0" hspace="5"><br>
							Unfortunately the Panthers are actually a very good side indeed and given their predisposition to go behind and then stage comebacks for fun &#150; it was still going to be a war of attrition, and so it proved. They have good shape, play some nice one touch football and have confidence. So it turned out that the goal didn&rsquo;t have that much impact on the half as the Panthers bared their teeth, put together some sleek passing and clawed their way back into the game (ok, ok&#x2026;won&rsquo;t do anymore of that, promise). As halftime neared Vags were caught by a very swift counter and exposed down the right &#150; long ball was played across the field and Graham lobbed to shouts of &lsquo;oh no&rsquo; by the keeper himself.<br>
							<br>
							1-1 at half time and that is how it was to remain &#150; very tight and edgy in the second half, some good chances at both ends (free kick off the bar for the Panthers and a one on one plus a header from a corner inches wide for the Vags). A defeat would probably have been harsh on either team and if the return match is as good as this then I would get yourselves along to watch it. Man of the match for me was Ken who ran all over the place although there were quite a few candidates out there.<br>
