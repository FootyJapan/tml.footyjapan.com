									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 29th August</b><br>
										IFG Panthers had a dramatic start to their opening TML division 2 match. Boasting a brand new pink jersey they started against Barbarians with slick football to justify their choice of outfit! Barbarians were strong and determined from the start but the first 20 minutes were pretty much played in their half as Panthers dominated possession and territory. <br>
										<br>
											Panthers looked strong in midfield winning most of the first and second balls and used the width well, forcing many crosses and corners. In terms of chances Panthers were restricted to shots from the edge of the box as they struggled to make any decisive in roads. The closest the Panthers got was when a cross was headed out just outside the penalty box to the incoming Ben Cordier who crashed a sweet volley goal bound but somehow the Barbarians keeper made an outstanding save diving to his right.<br>
										<br>
										After 13 games unbeaten in the TML 3rd division last season Panthers were confident or carrying forward their form into this game, however they quickly learnt that the quality of opposition is higher in this division, and in particular up front Barbarians had quality forwards with strength and pace. Against the run of play Panthers found themselves a goal down. The Barbarians striker ran at the defensive 3 which backed off too far, giving him a clear shot at goal from the edge of the box which flew into the bottom corner. <br>
										<br>
										Barbarians gained confidence and for the first time in the game were on top &#150; next their other striker Toshi scored almost an identical goal to his strike partner. Once again the defence was exposed and couldn&rsquo;t close him down in time. Panthers tried to respond quickly, but again the Barbarian defence and goalkeeper were resolute. Soon before half time Toshi struck again with what would surely be the killer blow, another counter attack straight from a Panthers corner. Toshi ran from the half-way line cut, into the box and fired a left foot shot which seemed to go through the keepers legs. <br>
										<br>
										3-0 down at half-time was difficult to take, seeing that we had dominated possession and overall goal attempts, however it was also a valuable lesson that unless we take our chances and defend in better numbers it counts for nothing. Second half started exactly as the first did &#150; Panthers dictating possession whilst Barbarians defended in numbers and broke dangerously. About 10 minutes in Barbarians came at the Panthers back 3 again, Toshi beat 2 defenders on the left wing, slipped a ball into the other striker just inside the penalty box left side. He then hit a rocket into the top right corner, across the Panthers keeper who didn&rsquo;t move. 4-0 down and surely game over.<br>
										<br>
										What unfolded in the final 30 minutes was better than Istanbul 2005. It coincided with a succession of long throws from which Rick Zwart will prove to be a weapon on which Panthers can rely on when in need of a goal out of nowhere. Panthers first goal came from a long throw into Ben Cordier, who with back to goal chested the ball and somehow looped an overhead effort into the far corner of the goal. 4-1 and Panthers spirits were lifted. The next 20 minutes or so became a scrappy affair with a succession of throws, corners and free kicks as Panthers laid siege to the Barbarians goal. Second goal came from another throw which Shotaro headed straight in, 4-2. Next the ball came to Ben Cordier at the edge of the box (I think from yet another throw or corner) who hit a deflected shot into the roof of the net &#150; 4-3 and Panthers sensed the miracle comeback was on.<br>
										<br>
										With around 10 minutes left the ball broke to Shotaro on the right side of the penalty box. At a tight angle he cracked a bullet shot into the top left corner &#150; 4-4 and Panthers were ecstatic. With just 2 minutes remaining Kei bombed down the right flank cut into the box and showed great composure to pull the ball back to Ma who was rushing in from the left wing. He showed a cool head under pressure to take a touch and then place a right side foot finish past the keeper. The miracle comeback was complete, 5-4 and 3 points!<br>
										<br>
										Overall there were a lot of good performances from the Panthers team &#150; Rick Zwart and Ben Cordier were giants in midfield, and Ma and Sho again were always running at the opposition and produced important goals when the team needed it. Panthers will need to improve defensively as a team as the back 3 were left exposed too often and will need better protection, it&rsquo;s not often that after a 4-0 head start we can come back to win! Next stop Misato&#x2026;<br>
