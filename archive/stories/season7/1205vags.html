						<p><b>YC&amp;AC Saturday 5th December.</b><br>
							Gradually comes to consciousness&#x2026;&#x2026;realises slowly that not only is it Saturday but Vags also have a game, good news&#x2026;..then realises that the game isn&rsquo;t until 19:30, day gets better. Goes back to sleep. Gets up, has a cigarette&#x2026;reflects on how lucky he was not to partake in the kitless, refereeless debacle of the previous weekend at Hachioji&#x2026;this prompts an unwanted image of Ged and Darren playing in their cycling shorts&#x2026;.starts to feel slightly queasy, but a coffee and another cigarette sorts this out (just). Thinks about the Hachioji turf&#x2026;..starting to show signs of wear and tear but always enjoys playing there&#x2026;takes a nap.<br>
							<br>
							Leaves the house in plenty of time, arrives early at Yonohonmachi, comes out the gates and - no Vags there&#x2026;queasy feeling comes back&#x2026;phones Richard who is waiting at Yamate station along with the rest of the Vags&#x2026;.oh shit&#x2026;63 kms away&#x2026;decides to rush down anyway&#x2026;.has second thoughts going through Shinjuku, might as well go home&#x2026;but gets a call from Richard saying the game has kicked off 20 minutes late&#x2026;.will get a half&#x2026;.thank you gods&#x2026;.arrives 10 minutes before half time, is informed the game is poised at 1-1 and he is a dozy (choose your expletive here although those who know me might plump for something ending in &lsquo;k&rsquo; &#150; still leaves more than one option, of course)&#x2026;comes on and wanders around aimlessly for 5 minutes whilst trying to actually orient himself to the fact that this is not Hachioji. Latches onto a short back-pass, rounds the keeper and slots home to put the Vags 2-1 up&#x2026;&#x2026;oh joy&#x2026;.comes off at half time to jests and japes about the fact that he is a dozy&#x2026;&#x2026;<br>
							<br>
							Second half starts&#x2026;.has a couple of shots blocked&#x2026;.then gets a nice through ball and is able to run at the defence&#x2026;.takes it an extra yard away from the defender and left foot from 15 yards across the keeper&#x2026;.salvation&#x2026;Vags 4-3 up&#x2026;..5 minutes later nice interplay with Ollie and again makes the same diagonal run at the defence and this time right foot but same place and same result &#150; 5-3 and game surely safe&#x2026;..hears shouts of brilliant from Richard on the sidelines&#x2026;assumes Richard is talking about his good self, puffs out chest just a little but not enough to come across as arrogant, of course&#x2026;.picks up a knock while completing the hat-trick and comes off&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;.just another day&#x2026;&#x2026;. <br>
							<br>
							For the rest of us bit players on this &lsquo;plonker Saturday&rsquo; the other action went as follows. Vags edged in front after a wicked Lyndsey corner was headed home at close range by Ollie&#x2026;.Dutch were strong though and made a few chances from set pieces and counters&#x2026;scoring from one such quick break to equalize. Above mentioned keeper rounding made it 2-1. Second half was a flurry of goals &#150; Dutch making it 2-2 and then 3-2 to them in quick succession from a set play and an agonizing bit of disarray in the penalty box. Muzzy nodded in from close range after a bit of pinball finally came across goal &#150; Darren may have got the final touch but magnanimously left it as Muzzy&rsquo;s goal because otherwise he&rsquo;s never going to catch Evans in the scoring charts. Also Darren may have cut a deal to get a certain fashionable black and gold woolly hat, belonging to Muzzy, that he obviously has his eye on&#x2026;.<br>
							<br>
							Then Evans wrapped it up with two great finishes but goals could have continued to be scored at both ends right until the final whistle &#150; notably an excellent free kick off the bar for the Dutch.<br>
							<br>
							Job done &#150; and while there were some negatives in this performance it is still another 3 points and momentum is building. <br>
							<br>
							Lyndsey was easily man of the match for me despite a yellow card. The card was justified for a late tackle but nothing malicious in it at all. I know this because if there really was anything malicious in it Mr. Dutchman would never have got up again.<br>
