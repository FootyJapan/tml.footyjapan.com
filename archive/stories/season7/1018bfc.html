						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 18th October.</b><br>
							BFC went into this fixture following a first defeat of the season at the hands of a typically combative Celts' team but also in the knowledge that they were yet to register a victory over Lions in their two previous meetings. Game on.<br>
							<br>
							Pre match talk was all about the need to match them in the tackle first and let the football do the talking. Early exchanges were pretty much as planned from BFC until a well directed flick on from the useful Lions attacker saw the ball bounce in no man's land between keeper and the last man Brian. A race to get there was duly won by a Lions' player who toe poked the ball over BFC keeper Tepi. 1-0 Lions. The rest of the half was mostly about BFC possession followed by Lions breaking. With a handful of very skilful (not to mention powerful) lads in the Lions' side they break well having the ability to hold the ball up while numbers come forward - and they do come forward. Other than a minor nosebleed incident though the half passed into history with little to write home about.<br>
							<br>
							Half time team talk was all positive. We'd had the possession, had created a number of chances and, if we could get one past Orlando, the game was there for the taking. And so it would prove. BFC showed some real class throughout the half despite Lions' best efforts to thwart some slick early passing football - Carlos, Robbie and Alex being at the center of most things. The goals came from Jon Day and Pabs, with Sho (again) grabbing an assist. 4 goals from Pabs in as many games and a hat-full of assists from Sho, not to mention goals, has been a real bonus for BFC this season, with last season's top scorers (Jon Day and Carlos) just biding their time before their inevitable rise up the top scorers table - those goals will come and come soon.<br>
							<br>
							All credit to Lions though who fought well with Orlando (as ever) proving to be a cut above the rest. With their full team out they will continue to trouble the top sides. For BFC it's another good win..<br>
