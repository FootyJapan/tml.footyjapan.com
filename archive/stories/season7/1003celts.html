									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 3rd October.</b><br>
										Kanto Celts proved too strong to a seemingly under strength Geokes outfit in Misato on Saturday.<br>
										1 point from 9 going into this game, the Celts were desperate for 3 points to kick start their season. The general consensus though was that the gods weren&rsquo;t smiling on us for last week&rsquo;s 1-1 against the Lions. <br>
										The best squad to turn out for the Celts in quite a while started the game on the front foot, first to every ball, Kevin Morgan&rsquo;s return to the team making a particular impact. In amateur football, when a strong centre half attacks the ball and wins every header it often nullifies the opponents&rsquo; attack and so it proved for the rest of the afternoon. Will also started the game particularly hungry to win every challenge. The two new additions to the Celts midfield Wataru and Jesper began the game showing the kind of commitment to winning the ball that the Celts scouts are particularly keen to find. Jo was proving to be a handful with some tireless and intelligent running. Take provided some quality crossing and only some fine saves from the Gekoes keeper kept the score level. A feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu came to mind from last week&rsquo;s game when we couldn&rsquo;t convert numerous chances. Mid way through the first way brought great relief to Celts then as Take was put through by Toru and coolly lifted the ball over the keeper. 10 minutes later Toru headed home from a corner to emphasise the Celts&rsquo; dominance. <br>
										<br>
										The Gekoes to their credit lifted their game at the beginning of the second half but the Celts always looked dangerous on the counter if they could just stay onside. Jo finally got his reward by shooting first time from a through ball to loop it over the keeper from a difficult angle. 3-0 and the Celts looked to be enjoying their football for the first time this season. Gavin manager (understandably) decided changes were necessary however, and numerous substitutions and positional changes gave Gekoes the impetus to get back in the game. A good cross from the left side put the Celts defence under pressure, the ball fell kindly to the outside right who duly finished giving Aki no hope in goal. Once again the hoops easily lost their composure in a game and Gekoes seemed to feel that there might be something in this game for them. Resolved was stiffened though and Wataru even took the ball into the corner. Shocking stuff from a side who were cruising for three quarters of the game. Thanks to the referee for a good common sense approach, forceful decisions, and hilarious banter.<br>
