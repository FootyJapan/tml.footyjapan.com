						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 28th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							As the only team to put a dent in the Panther&rsquo;s otherwise flawless championship campaign (a 1-1 draw back in October). The Panthers v Vagabonds rematch was always going to be a highly anticipated fixture.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The Vags came into the game following back-to-back defeats and were looking to get their own stalled promotion push back on track. An assortment of injuries and excuses led to some notable absences leaving an 11 and a half man squad<br>
							(Lyndsey being there in body but not in mind) for the evening outing to the soggy and tired looking Hachioji Park.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;Players from both teams were well aware of one another&rsquo;s ability through playing together at futsal and in other competitions, which only added to the excitement of the fixture. &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;Trying to take a team seriously who wear a kit that appears to have been washed when someone accidentally left a red sock in the machine can be difficult, however with an unbeaten record and a massive +34 goal difference to date it is obvious that the football is what does the talking.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The game kicked off and immediately reached the high tempo that would maintain throughout the 80 minutes. &nbsp;The Vags had early possession with Amos making a number of probing runs down the wing and winning 50/50 balls in the middle of the park. The Vags midfield were well aware of the threat posed by the central duo of Zwort and Cordier and set about limiting their influence on the game, resulting in the Panthers turning to the long ball which was coolly dealt with by the level headed and experienced Vags defensive line of Ged, Darren and Wayne.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;For all of the attacking talent on display (Ben Cordier 13 goals, Muzzy 9 goals) the first 15 minutes witnessed few clear cut chances as the defensive play of both teams cancelled one another out; however the large amounts of surface water in the goal mouths meant that the keepers had to be alert to avoid any embarrassment with the back pass.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;As the half progressed the Vags began to get the better of the two teams with the ball being played from the back and distributed down the flanks to the Vags attacking front two of Muzzy and Al Himmer, who held the ball up well resulting in a number of set pieces, one of which would lead to the opening goal.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;On about 20 minutes the deadlock was finally broken as a free kick found the&nbsp;&nbsp; glancing head of Ken, about 12 yards out, and was angled into the path of the approaching Vags debutant, Tom Sheard. Failing to hesitate he hit it on the half volley past the stranded Sid Lloyd. 1-0 Vags.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;As so often happens a goal can spur on a fight-back and that is what happened when a 10-minute spell of attacking pressure from the Panthers created a number of&nbsp; chances, notably Tom Thurman&rsquo;s drive that was hit painstakingly inches wide of the post. Other efforts followed only to be denied by a display of fine goalkeeping from Graham Burt. Whether the small fortune paid for the new goalkeeping gloves will prove to be a wise investment only time will tell, but when it counted they proved to be worth every yen!&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Half time score Panthers 0 - BFC Vagabonds 1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The second half restarted and once again served up much of what had previously gone before, Vags strong at the back and busy in midfield, few clear cut chances, and little for the keepers to do. What also continued was the aerial battle in midfield that Rick Zwort managed to get a grip of, however the second ball was often picked up first by the battling trio of Ian Warner, Ken and Tom, unfortunately this possession wasn&rsquo;t always converted into chances.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;Al and Muzzy continued to hold the ball well and started to create a number of chances for one another but any loose balls were quickly picked up by the Panthers back four, which like Darren for the Vags, was being calmly directed both vocally and physically by Matt Lennon, regardless of the pressure from the Vags attackers.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;Suddenly out of nothing came a rare clear-cut chance on goal. A result of Sid miss reading the soggy surface and playing the ball to the feet of Muzzy only to see him put it wide, it could have and should have been 2-0 Vags but Sid&rsquo;s blushes were to be saved for another day.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;A number of changes took place part way through the second half with Tom Thurman taking a short break, and Lyndsey coming on for the hard working Wayne ( or was it Steve?!).&nbsp; It was also evident that the Vags midfield of Ian and Tom were now beginning to tire as cramp from playing 80 minutes (ironically for the Panthers sister team, the Pumas) earlier in the day began to set in. This also signalled a resurgence of the Panther&rsquo;s midfield with Romen and Ben now beginning to influence the game more.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The tide began to turn as the Panthers pushed forward but once again to no avail as Ged, Darren and Steve maintained a hold of the younger Panther&rsquo;s attackers. The Panthers pressure was rewarded with an effort from Romen striking the woodwork and also leading to a flurry of corners. Once again it was a set piece that saw the ball in the back of the net for the second time in the evening. The Panther&rsquo;s height advantage finally paid off as a crisp corner was met by the head of Tom Thurman, levelling the scores. Panthers 1 BFC&nbsp; Vags 1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The game was still there to be won by either side and whilst Lyndsey may have been carrying the mother of all hangovers he wasn&rsquo;t showing it as he produced some slick passing down the left flank to earn the Vags a series of corners but the ball just wouldn&rsquo;t drop to reward Al and Muzzy for their running.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;As legs got tired Ken was able to use his pace to his advantage with some probing runs but the Vags second goal never materialised.&nbsp; With a bounty of British and Commonwealth players on display the game was always going to be physical and it is surprising that the referee, although after talking with numerous players never had to use his book, even though a tired challenge by Tom Sheard on Ben Cordier should probably have been punished.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;The decisive goal came as a result of another set piece, a penalty. Whipped in from the left a Panther&rsquo;s corner evidently led to the ball looping up onto Wayne&rsquo;s hand, Darren led the &lsquo;ball to hand&rsquo; protests but the referee, somewhat apologetically, gave the penalty. It was sweetly struck by Ben Cordier to beat Graham and his &lsquo;Million Dollar&rsquo; gloves who had guessed the right way. Panthers 2 BFC Vagabonds 1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;For all but the score line, the game was very close to call with the teams mirroring one another in style. The Vags will feel hard done by for not gaining at least a point, especially from a contentious penalty decision. The spoils and the 3 points went to the Panthers, but ultimately this was a game that truly reflects the spirit of the TML, fare play and respect, a cracking game of football, and a huge hangover!<br>
