									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 6th September</b><br>
										It took the BEFC nineteen games to get a win last season, but this time around they started off with a convincing victory under the floodlights at YC&amp;AC against last season&rsquo;s champs 2nd string. <br>
										Early season enthusiasm saw a 16-man squad meet early and indulge their pre-match ritual of twatting balls high and wide of an unmanned goal. However, once the game kicked off the serious football started and some of the Embassy&rsquo;s moves in the first twenty minutes were as good as seen in the whole of last season. Beginning from the back, calmly knocking the ball through midfield and finally up to Alex or Steve up front, a series of chances were created. Two were taken. First,  Masa nodded down for Steve to blast home; soon after, Alex was the beneficiary in the 6 yard box after a cross was contested by a crowd of players and the ball dropped for him to rifle home. It could have been many more - the keeper making one tremendous outstretched save from a typical Takanori piledriver.  <br>
										BEFC were cruising but the game suddenly took a turn with about ten minutes to go in the first half. A hopeful ball forward saw some hesitation at the back and the experienced striker lashed home a goal to put YC&amp;AC back in the game. With them smelling an equalizer, Keith made a pair of crucial stops, the second of which coming just before the whistle for the interval, and meant the Embassy&rsquo;s team talk at half-time revolved around keeping calm and reproducing the football of the first half hour. The Embassy never quite reached that level but nevertheless created a load more chances mostly coming from the threat of Ryuta&rsquo;s pace. He got his reward when he nodded in a far post cross from Takanori. That restored the two-goal cushion and the rest of the game was played out in a controlled fashion. 3-1 &#150; job done.<br>
										All-in-all then, a very satisfactory day for BEFC. Ferdy, aided by the composed Craig, was at his combative best; Takanori showed off his range of passing to the flanks, where Masa, Osamu, or Tetsu put in decent deliveries; the strikers delivered, with all three notching a goal; and at the back Rob, Ian and Gazza dealt well with experienced strikers, and Richie, Tim and Willie snuffed out danger from the flank while Keith proved there&rsquo;s life in the old dog yet. And, it must be added a very easy game (save some banter about (ahem) &ldquo;false throws&rdquo;) for the ref to handle. Those beers (and err.. milkshakes?) in the clubhouse sure tasted sweet! Same again next time!<br>
