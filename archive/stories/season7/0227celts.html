						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 27th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Three straight losses going into this game meant that a very determined Celts squad assembeld in Soga on Saturday night. Two narrow loses to YCAC and BFC added to a heavy, heavy loss to Hibs left the Celts wondering what they had done to upset the footballing gods. Celts also felt hard done by the 1-1 result earlier on in the season between these two teams. <br>
							A small but strong squad then took to the field with a suprising boost that Orlando was not between the sticks for Lions. When the game got underway it became apparent that the Lions were also without several other quality regulars. The game opened with the Celts pinning the Lions back through Andrew, Toru and Wataru winning every first ball. Tomo and Kev always looked comfortable at centre halves and Will and Jasper always provided an outlet when needed. Several good chances were created but it took a good twenty minutes of continuous pressure and wasted chances before Celts could take the lead. A couple of good blocks from Lions and a save from Mo saw the ball drop to Toru just inside the box. A low and true strike resulted in relief all round for the hoops.<br>
							<br>
							The lack of pressure from Lions meant that the Celts had plenty of time to keep possesion and played some good football for the rest of the half. A fine swtich pass from Toru found McGill in space on the right. A mis-hit volley cross went up so high the ball came down with snow on it. Henry Monaghan keep it eye on it all the way though and headed the ball in off the post from the edge of the box. Very John Hartson. Five minutes later, the impressive Take made found himself in space on the left. A clever ball around the corner to put McGill in for a one on one although at an angle. McGill slipped the ball past the (rather slow) outrushing keeper. The ball seemed to be going in but goal hungry Monaghan thought he would add to his tally thank you very much. Very Darren Bent. In the post match interview it was all about the &quot;three points being the most important&quot; but methinks this was a chance to shut up his critics who maintain that he doesn't score enough. A slight difference of opinion between two opposing players caused a slight distruption at the end of the first half but Celts went in very happy to go in 3-0 up. <br>
							<br>
							The second half took a similar pattern with the Celts even more determined to play some football. Many chances were created and two were taken. A superd volley from the edge of the box from Jo Ninomiya and Henry also calmly finished off a good counter attack at the far post to claim his (well-deserved) hat-trick. A good performace and result, well done to Fred for the clean sheet in goal.<br>
							<br>
							Credit to the Lions who never gave up despite their depleted squad and credit also the referee who had a good game..<br>
