						<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 8th May.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							There's no place like YCAC in Japan.&nbsp; When you step through the gates you enter a little piece of Yokohama that will be forever England.&nbsp; The football is 100% made in England too.&nbsp; None of your continental namby pamby stuff, this is proper football; long balls, headers, crunching tackles and total commitment.&nbsp; Not the sort of place you want to come to pick up the single point needed to clinch the division championship.&nbsp; There was also the small matter of revenge for YCAC over the early season meeting with Panthers where Ma's quality finish in injury time led to uproar over the ref's time keeping, and some serious questioning of his dubious parentage!&nbsp; Still, we all know lightning never strikes twice, right?..........<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Conditions were perfect with a good number of spectators, including a fine group of WAGs (wives and girlfriends).&nbsp; Actually, what is the collective noun for WAGs?&nbsp; It's a waggle, according to Wikipedia, but I think I prefer wiggle &#150; conjures up more of a picture.&nbsp; So, a wiggle of WAGS, a perfect pitch and all to play for.&nbsp; Panthers brought along a good squad of 14, but three were carrying injuries.&nbsp; A&nbsp; welcome return for Rick, who'll be a massive loss next season when he returns to New Zealand and Lars who's been pure quality in defense but is leaving too, for China.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The match kicked off and the YCAC boys wasted no time in letting us know we were in a game.&nbsp; Looking to use their height and strength advantage, they were playing direct football, aiming for a knock-on to split the Panther's defense, but with Phil marshaling the back line and sweeping up any loose balls, not too many worries early doors.&nbsp; Romen, Ben and &ldquo;special&rdquo; Kei were meeting every challenge in the middle of the park and still managing to keep possession and launch the Panther's attacking options.&nbsp; Tom was a great outlet, holding the ball up and linking with Sho and Ma to get behind the YCAC defense.&nbsp; This proved the key to the breakthrough after about 15 minutes.&nbsp; Great battling by Kei won the ball back in the Panther's half and after Andy threaded a pass to Tom, he turned his defender and fed Sho who skipped past the keeper to finish.&nbsp; 1-0 Panthers.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Panthers began to open up YCAC with some defense splitting passes from the midfield trio that released Tom and Sho into dangerous areas.&nbsp; A couple of near misses were followed by a well-timed burst from Tom and when he dinked the ball past the keeper, he was cleaned out for the clearest stone wall penalty of the season.&nbsp; Result, a goal kick!&nbsp; I'm still scratching my head 3 days later.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Having weathered the Panthers onslaught, YCAC were far from done and were launching a few forays of their own.&nbsp; A flick on released their left winger behind the Panther's defense and he swung over a deep cross that cleared me but not their lanky attacker who managed to get enough on it to keep the ball in play.&nbsp; Confident in the knowledge that Orlando doesn't give penalties, I gave the attacker a little nudge as we battled for the second header, just to even up the physical disparity you understand, and bugger me if he doesn't give a penalty!&nbsp; Despite my best Vicky Pollard impression,.....yeah but...no but....no but....yeah but...., the ref was unmoved and a great chance for YCAC to get back into the game.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Now there are two ways in my book to take a penalty, either you place it firmly in the bottom corner or you hit it with power into the top half of the goal.&nbsp; Well actually, there is a third method.&nbsp; You can get so far under the ball that it goes 15 feet over the cross bar, a difficult skill but one that was made to look easy by Neil Shonnard for YCAC.&nbsp; I think it actually cleared the YCAC swimming pool &#150; no mean feat!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Unfortunately, Panthers didn't heed the warning and a few minutes later, after more good work down the left, a ball across the penalty area was finished expertly by Matt Wallace into the bottom corner and YCAC were level.&nbsp; Half time 1-1.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Second half underway and Panthers began to assert control in the midfield.&nbsp; Kei and Ben winning more than their fair share of the headers and Romen doing the tidying up.&nbsp; At the back, Phil, Lars and Rick were looking really solid and the team had the platform in place to let the flair players work their magic.&nbsp; Frank was becoming more and more influential down the left, combining well with Sho and Ma as the Panthers probed for the opening.&nbsp; His floated cross was met with a superb volley from Mark that crashed off the bar but was called for a marginal offside.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							As the YCAC began to tire, they started to drop deeper and Panthers really took control of the game.&nbsp; A succession of chances came and went as the pressure was piled on.&nbsp; Ben smashed a shot against the underside of the bar and only heroic defending prevented the Panthers taking a lead.&nbsp; Frank played a neat little one-two with Sho on the edge of the area but his goal bound shot was deflected to safety by another last ditch YCAC tackle.&nbsp; Not even one of Romen's now legendary &ldquo;floaters&rdquo; could break the deadlock.&nbsp; Receiving the ball about 30 yards out, he launched one of his trade mark &ldquo;shuttle cocks.&rdquo;&nbsp; It's like a scene from The Matrix when the world seems to stand still and everyone holds their breath.&nbsp; The young YCAC keeper wasn't to be fooled though and he made a fine save tipping it over the cross bar to keep the scores level.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							It was looking like one of those games when the ball just wasn't going find the net no matter what we did.&nbsp; A fantastic and fully committed 2nd half defensive display from YCAC was worthy of a draw, but this Panthers team have made a habit of re-writing the script in the dying moments of games.&nbsp; With the clock ticking away the last few seconds, Frank picked up the ball wide on the left, he cut inside the defender and unleashed an absolute pearler into the far top corner &#150; unstoppable!&nbsp; Like he'd just scored the winner for Flamengo in the Copa Liberadores final, he ripped of his shirt and set off on a mad Brazilian shirt-waving celebration chased by his compadres.&nbsp; What a way to seal the championship.&nbsp; Carnival time at YCAC!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							A matter of seconds after the re-start, the whistle went for the end of the game, a real gut-wrencher for YCAC as they suffered another last minute heart ache.&nbsp; It's understandable that feelings are going to run high after a finish like that, and things got a bit heated in a dispute over time keeping (strange deja vu moment) but credit to Orlando for keeping a lid on it.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
