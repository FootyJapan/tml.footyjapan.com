									Nil-nil draws are very unusual in the TML, from a quick review of the results from all three divisions this season, only one other game has remained goalless. Whether the lack of clean sheets is due to the attacking flair of the league's strikers or the ineptitude of its defenders is open to debate. In this case it was certainly a case of the defenders having better control of the game rather than a lack of effort from the forwards. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season7/1129rwc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

The Old boys then took on the Tartan Army, taking a 1-0 lead right into the final stages of the match before the TA kitted out in a very nice St Andrews Cross strip, equalized just before the end. The Final match was a battle for the Tartan Challenge Sheild between Martin Burns' Tokyo CSC and the TA led by Mark Sims. CSC took this by storm 4-1 despite going a goal down, but it was all played in great spirit.. <a class="txlink" href="http://sport.scotsman.com/scotlandsfootballteam/It39s-a-case-of-.5723407.jp#4509071" target="_blank">more from the Scotsman ...</a><br>

								<h1 class="red">TML NEEDS YOUR HELP</h1>
								<p>Setagaya Koen, 10 minutes out of Shibuya, has a beautiful 3rd generation pitch (some of you may have played there last season). Unfortunately it is usually used for baseball so it's difficult to book it for the league. It has come to our attention that from November 1st, despite having floodlights, the ground closes at 5:00pm instead of 9:00pm as it does in the summer. This is because baseballers don't play in the cold winter evenings &amp; they have been closing early since the days when it was a dirt ground. We have spoken to the Ward Office about having the ground open til 9:00pm during these winter months as us footballers would be happy to use it, but of course getting this done could take a while as it must go though committees that will take time to process the request. What could speed up the process is if they get lots of requests through the 'comments' page of their website. If you don't read or write Japanese, please could you ask your spouse, girlfriend, co-worker to fill in the form (<b>JAPANESE ONLY</b>) <a class="txlink" href="https://www2.city.setagaya.tokyo.jp/goiken/iken_kumin_csv.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> requesting that the ground be made available in the evenings from November. Don't worry if you don't live in Setagaya-ku, anyone can fill in the form, the more the merrier! This could help us secure a much needed ground in a very good location.

								<h1 class="navy">It All Kicks Off at Oi Futo</h1>
								<p><b>OiFuto, Saturday 29th August</b><br>
									The 7th season of TML got underway at Oi Futo on Saturday lunchtime under a blazing sun and temperatures in the mid 30's. It was Division 3 newcomers IFG Pumas led by Nick Webb (pictured) who got the latest season underway, against Sun United FC. Unfortuantely for Pumas though, it didn't quite go to plan as they were defeated 3-1. A total of 7 matches were played on the opening weekend, spread out between locations in Tokyo, Chiba, Yokohama and Kawasaki. This season could see teams having to play further afield due to the lack of availability on more local pitches and the closing of Misato in late October (one of our main grounds last season).<br>
									Facilities in and around Tokyo are few &amp; far between, with thousands of people vying for those that are available, so any help in securing grounds would be most appreciated and rewarded (financially) by the league. Please help us help you!.<br>

								<p><b>YCAC, Sunday, August 23rd</b><br>
									Just 1 goal separated the top 2 teams in this Summers inaugural Magnificent 7's summer league, with YC&amp;AC taking the silverware at the expense of BFC. YC&amp;AC had gone into the final game of the tournament leading the group by a 2 goal better difference than BFC but having to face 3rd placed ((by -4 GD) Hibs. BFC however had to play mid table Shane FC, so there was everything to play for. On the night, all 10 teams showed up with full squads, with the exception of Hibs who just fielded 6 players.Still they held YCAC at 0-0 until 5 minutes from time, while BFC took a storming 6-1 lead that looked to have won the title for them. But once Hibs conceded a goal, the flood-gates opened and YCAC stormed to a 4-0 win that was enough to just pip BFC to the post as the latter finished 7-2 winners. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/pages/magnificent7s.html#m7results" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
									This proved to be a very popular league for all inviolved, so Footy Japan are looking to start a mid-week Magnificent 7's league at Oi Futo Astro from October.&nbsp;<br>
