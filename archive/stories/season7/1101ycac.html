						<p><b>YCAC, Sunday 1st November.</b><br>
							YC&amp;AC 1st team put on a goal rush show on Sunday afternoon, scoring five goals against their old Nemesis, captain Guido Geisler's well commanded Sala FC. <br>
							<br>
							A solid mix of veterans with some fairly young yet experienced talents with a strong work ethic, Sala did seem to be the first team able to stop YC&amp;AC 1st team's 14th consecutive TML victory  since February 1st, 2009 against the Swiss Kickers. <br>
							<br>
							Indeed, Sala struck first in the 10th minute on a goal by Koji Watanabe, who was left unmarked on the near post after a free kick.<br>
							<br>
							Although trailing Sala 0-1 wasn't that long; YC&amp;AC scored an equalizer as Jinung Chong intercepted an errant pass, split a pair of defenders and punished the opposing keeper to the near post soon after, whilst Satoshi Mitsuda goal gave YC&amp;AC a 2-1 lead by half time.<br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;AC answered the 2nd half with three more goals; volley by Shigehiro Yamazaki was somewhat lucky as it crossed the goal line after a Sala goalkeeper deflect, but goals from Hidenori Yoshioka and Mitsuda were both well desereved as a reward of great team effort shown by the YC&amp;AC throughout the game.<br>
							<br>
							Being 1-5 down, though the captaincy and pride of Geisler didn't allow Sala to accept an easy loss. Instead, they continuously sought for the opportunity to score their second goal through some counter attacks; the passing through Peter Swinny, Shigeru Chino to the kinds of Toby Long and Stu Anderson were causing somewhat trouble for the YC&amp;AC defense, but wasn't enough to penetrate through without the support of midfield.<br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;AC's 4th victory of the season gave the club the right to brag about their 14th consecutive winning in TML and also a secured 4th place in the league table with two games in hand whilst BFC claims 1st with 16 points.<br>
							<br>
							YC&amp;AC returns to action against Robert Walters Geckoes on Sunday, November 15th after facing Japan Airlines Football Club (JFA affiliated Tokyo Metropolitan League 3rd division) on Sunday, November 8th.<br>
