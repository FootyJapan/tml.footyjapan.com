						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 27th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							We love 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like&nbsp;a cute Japanese t-shirt this is how the resurgent Sala feel.&nbsp; Continuing their current good form, Sala&nbsp;cruised past&nbsp;Saitama Jets 3-0 in the league, then bossed the Celts 3-1 in the cup, picking up deserved victories in both games.&nbsp; Jets were technical and fast without much threat and Celts were skillful, direct and physical without much speed.&nbsp; These are two styles that Sala love to play against and it showed in&nbsp;both games.&nbsp; Were it YCAC's or International's blend of speed, skill&nbsp;AND directness then no doubt Sala would have went down.&nbsp; Read on for all the juice&nbsp;from both games!<br>
							<br>
							The Jets game was won with goals from Toby, Sam and Jesus.&nbsp; Whereas the Celts game was won with goals from Stu (honestly!), Koji and Toby.&nbsp; Celts solitary reply coming through a calamitous own-goal from Dan &quot;worst jokes in the world &quot;&nbsp;Bard.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							The Jets game was even stevens for most of the first half, but with the brawn of a oba-san trying to get a seat on a packed train, Toby forced his way through the Jets defence, and whilst holding off the peskiest of Jets defenders, slotted past the keeper.&nbsp; The goal sent the mostly unrecognisable heads of the Jet's&nbsp;team tumbling and gave Sala the confidence to push on for more.&nbsp; <br>
							<b>1-0 Sala</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							In the second half, Sala threatened several times from range, the same way the Jets had in the first half, but it wasn't until a blunder from the Jet's keeper that Sala got their second.&nbsp; Having misjudged the bounce of a bobbling ball in the box, the keeper&nbsp;watched in agony as&nbsp;the ball fell kindly&nbsp;to the spry and ever-alert Sam, who controlled it and nudged it home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was a&nbsp;hard finish&quot; Sam said later, but everyone just laughed including the nun and the fat controller.&nbsp; &quot;Don't talk shite, Sam&quot; was the general concensus.&nbsp; It was easier than a Daily Yomiuri crossword.&nbsp; But what can you expect from a lad who taught the Artful Dodger how to blag.&nbsp; <b>2-0 Sala</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Before Sala added their third, Lenny cleared two Jet's shots off the line which kept Sala's clean sheet in tact.&nbsp; This was reflective of the hard work Sala put in all over the park, and with Masa adding a touch of class in the opposing third when he swept over a sublime cross for Jesus to bullet home a bible busting&nbsp;header, it was clear Sala&nbsp;deserved to take home all three points.&nbsp; <b>3-0 Sala</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Man of the Match</b> - Toby, for his goal and his all round play, just pipping Lenny.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Sinner of the Match</b> -&nbsp;Not Jesus, that's for sure!&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Hachioji Park, Sunay 7th March.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							With a skip and a dash it's on to the Cup.&nbsp; Like Tottenham&nbsp;everyone loves a good cup game but&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;most teams&nbsp;hardly ever win it.&nbsp; Unpredictable by nature and format, full of dreams usually shattered, but occassionally realised, that's why we love it, and the TML Cup is no different.&nbsp; Unless your Jethro F.C. and can't be arsed&nbsp;turning up.&nbsp; Ouch!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Sala vs Celts was a mouthwatering tie as both teams are always evenly matched, physical and commited.&nbsp; Nothing changed in this match.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Celts had the better of the play early on, with Henry, playing striker,&nbsp;holding the ball up well and linking&nbsp;play with his&nbsp;orange-shoed compadre.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;once&nbsp;Sala's battle-hardened&nbsp;backline, led by Ian, and aided by Guido and Scotty in midfield, got to grips with Henry's threat,&nbsp;Sala were able to assert&nbsp;their dominance&nbsp;in midfield, where a few of the Celts midfielders went missing, and push play into the Celt's half.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							With chances at a premium, Brookey came closest to scoring at his own end, looping a&nbsp;defensive header onto&nbsp;the bar.&nbsp; Close one!&nbsp; Dan, who was watching, obviously&nbsp;thought he could do better.&nbsp; And, later, he did.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Henry then rose above Guido, for one of the few times in the match, and narrowly missed with his own header from a corner, before Stu broke the deadlock.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bit of pinball in the middle,&nbsp;Pete rolled his man which created space for Stu. Through on the keeper, he slotted a low composed finish&nbsp;between the&nbsp;keeper's legs. Usually noted for his workrate, hold-up play, terrible jumping ability and his uncanny resemblance to Big Bird from Sesame Street, it was a sweet moment to savour for the big lad, who was recently likened to Emile Heskey (without the 4 goals a season!)&nbsp; <b>Double ouch!&nbsp; 1-0 Sala</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Minutes later, Stu was nearly through again after a lovely through ball from Masa but the Celts slammed the door shut.&nbsp; Sala who were&nbsp;getting caught out with off-sides regularly, then produced their best move of the match.&nbsp;&nbsp;Toby, Brookey and Sam fashioned a great crossing opportunity for Sam, who put in an excellent cross right on the penalty spot.&nbsp; Unfortunately,&nbsp;Stu was on the end of it, and&nbsp;with the leap of a sickly 5yr old child, he&nbsp;only succeeded in putting the corner flag in peril .&nbsp; For Sam though, it was&nbsp;a cross Theo Walcott would have been proud of.&nbsp; Actually, he's shite, so it was a cross my Great Auntie Helen would have been proud of.&nbsp; She's a cracking winger and does a mean line in ibuprofen gel rub.&nbsp; Great for the muscles.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Anyway, it looked like Sala would go in at halftime with a precious lead, however&nbsp;the Celts suddenly burst fortuitously back into the game with an OG. &nbsp;Like Dan's jokes it was pants but strangely amusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taylor parried a shot which Scotty should have cleared but his stride pattern was wrong (ingenius excuse), so he only managed to whack it off Irn Bru shoes.&nbsp; The ball ricocheted back&nbsp;across the Sala goal and Dan lunged at it&nbsp;poking it into&nbsp;his own net.&nbsp; Doh! &nbsp;This goal was almost as shocking as the death of Corey Haim at the age of 38.&nbsp; Will there ever be a teen-vampire movie as good as The Lost Boys?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Anyway, thanks for the memories, Corey and thanks for nothing, <b>Danny boy, ya flaming gala!&nbsp; 1-1.</b><br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Celts then came close with an industrious run and shot from Willow, before&nbsp;Koji came close for Sala.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koji wasn't going to keep the cameras&nbsp;waiting long though and he conjured up a cracking strike moments later.&nbsp; Always one with an eye for Sala's annual goal of the season competition, he met a&nbsp;defensive clearance full on the volley, pounding it into the top corner with his left peg.&nbsp; The keeper got a hand to it but couldn't deal with the power of the strike.&nbsp; <b>2-1 Sala</b>.<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							At this point, Clarkey's wise halftime team talk&nbsp;started to make an impact too, and&nbsp;suddenly, the Celts' offside trap was like a hooker in Amsterdam; all over the place and totally up for grabs,&nbsp;with Pete especially,&nbsp;and Lenny, supplying through ball after through ball to anyone who wanted a shot at scoring.&nbsp;<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							Toby was&nbsp;at the front of the&nbsp;line.&nbsp; Getting all&nbsp;FIFA 2010 with himself, he first&nbsp;tried to chip the keeper from 30 yards but totally fluffed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he didn't push the d-pad away from the goal&nbsp;and put a header from Brookey's corner over the target.&nbsp; But finally, after holding the slow dribble button for&nbsp;what seemed like an eternity he guided a nice finish past the static Celts keeper.&nbsp; <b>3-1 Sala</b>.&nbsp; <br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
							Sala were all over the Celts by now and&nbsp;Ryo should have made it four after taking Lenny's threaded through ball and&nbsp;cutting inside his marker but he finished too high.<br>
							With the Celts mustering little in reply the game finished with Sala marching into the semis.<br>
							<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							M<b>an of the Match</b> - Guido.&nbsp; Lets smell what The Rock's cooking!<br>
							&nbsp;<br>
							<b>Sinner of the Match</b> - Dan Bard.&nbsp; After the OG he then compounded matters by describing an ex-teammate's body as &quot;hard ripped-ness&quot;.&nbsp; Oh dear.<br>
