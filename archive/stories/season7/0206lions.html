						<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 6th February.</b> &nbsp;<br>
							On a freezing night in Hachioji Park, Lions were looking to continue their good run of 3 wins against a strong BFC side, and although Lions were as usual missing crucial players, the game started well with Lions absorbing BFC attacks, until a cross that just slipped through Orlando&rsquo;s hand, fell beyond the BFC striker who pushed the ball into the net with his hands. As Lions laughed at the attempt, and the linesman flag up, surprisingly enough the goal was allowed!<br>
							To be fair, the BFC player didn&rsquo;t even celebrate the goal, and Lions couldn&rsquo;t believe their luck.<br>
							BFC had a good run down the left, and as their player cut across the box, he was given too much time to unleash a strong shot, beating Orlando, and making it 2-0.<br>
							Lions were still determined to get back into the game, but their night got worse when their top scorer Ken Hersche was injured (out for 4-6 weeks) following a late tackle that went unpunished.<br>
							Misery piled on Lions, when Carlos passed a late ball to Jon who was alone in the box, with the nearest Lions player at least 3 yards out of the box, yet the linesman flag was ignored again, and the goal was counted to the surprise of even the VAGs watching from the sidelines.<br>
							Lions by that time couldn&rsquo;t wait for the final whistle which was preceded by a soft goal from an uncleared corner, making it a flattering 4-0 to BFC, recording their second win against Lions this season, a complete contrast to the 1 point they picked up last season!<br>
							Lions may have looked miserable that night, but are still determined to turn their fortunes around this season, with the next match against YCAC promising to be another classic following the 4-2 defeat earlier in the season. Lions will be welcoming back Evis, Acai, Fahad, and most significantly, the return of the talented tall striker Zuhair for his first game of the season.<br>
							Man of the Match: What match?<br>
