									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 13th September</b><br>
										It had been over 12 months since BFC last played at Misato and in the week leading up to the game nobody was relishing turning out on the &quot;cowfield&quot; against a Geckoes side fresh from having chomped through Sala the previous week. As it was, we misread the omens as an unchanged (subs n all) BFC side had the edge on a depleted Geckoes side from the first hoof.<br>
										Orders from the off were to get it under, pass early but not mess about at the back. BFC pretty much stuck to this all game with everyone making pretty easy going of the conditions as they took control of the game in the first half. With an on-form Carlos dropping deep to shepherd the herd, that is when Robbie 'always available' Servais wasn't doing that job for him, BFC soon started to carve out a few openings, while BFC's North and South of the river (Thames) midfield enforcers: Kazu 'innit' Tadokoro and Pabs 'nuffsaid' Pomares, set about munching their way through anything Geckoes got too interested in. But, despite plenty of possession, the milk was in danger of turning sour as the half time whistle went with the score 0-0.<br>
										Half time chat was all about upping the tempo, giving that little bit extra and taking the game to Geckoes. And that is what happened. Within a few minutes of the off BFC were soon into their stride creating plenty of chances and nibbling away at the Geckoes resolve. With Evans 'off the bench and scores again' Kunyuga and Duncan 'ball into the box' Walsh providing plenty of excitement down the flanks it was left to Alex 'cream of the crop' Sahara to pull strings in the final third. It wasn't long before goals would come, and come they did - 3 in the space of 20 minutes or so, plus a missed PK, some wasted chances and some excellent saves from the Geckoes keeper - arguably their best player on the day.<br>
										All in all a decent run out for both teams with both having a lot more to come for sure. For BFC, it is two from two, with 7 scored and none conceded, meaning a headache for the manager with a number of regular starters still to come back into the side.<br>
