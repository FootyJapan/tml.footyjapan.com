								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 30th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									Division 3 is certainly tight this year. On any given day, any of the teams can beat each other, as the Jets 2nds found out when losing their last game to an improved Yabe. There was some pride to play for in this game, then, as the Jets sought to justify their place at the top of the league.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0130jets2.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									The JETs simply refuse to accept their place in the TML 'eco-chain' ... They brought half the J-League with them and a tea-cozy but their stubborn resistance was broken by an Aranda special.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0130bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>Setagaya Koen, Saturday 30th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									&#x2026;..............Well, not exactly, but you don't want to let the facts stand in the way of a good headline!<br>
									BEFC gave the Panthers a good game last time up, losing by just the odd goal in 5, and they weren't about to take it lying down this time around. Conditions were perfect with a clear blue sky, nice pitch at Setagaya Koen to show off our silky skills and for once, it didn't take an hour and half to get there. <a class="txlink" href="0130pants.html" target="_blank">more</a><br>

								<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday 23rd January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									With BFC&nbsp;missing a few key players, the match being played&nbsp;in Chiba and with the sun residing in Aquarius along with Venus (check your horoscopes...it's true!) there&nbsp;was the distinct smell of a shock in the air for this 3rd vs 3rd bottom TML clash.&nbsp; And, Sala delivered. Courtesy of&nbsp;wunderstrikes from Pete, Scotty and Shige.&nbsp; A solitary reply from Pabs for BFC meant Sala trumped this one&nbsp;3-1.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0123sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 24th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									As many TMLers can attest, worse than just having a hangover is having one and having to show up to the soccer ground and play a tough opponent. More than a few lucky Hibs players had that honor on Sunday, and our opponent was none other than the Geckoes, a team that has been improving a lot during the season and proved that by winning against FC International. <a class="txlink" href="0124hibs.html">more</a><br>

									3 times we have done battle with the &lsquo;basement&rsquo; team of the 2nd division and 3 times we have come out victorious but far from comfortable. It is a very good division.<br>
									<br>
									Vags started very positively and were 2 up within 10 minutes or so &#150; Muzzy hitting a deflected shot which spun high into the net after a great aerial challenge by Nao.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0123vags.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 24th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									Another battling performance by the Pumas saw the same result as last week: a glorious defeat. Is there such a thing? Yes. Being part of a 4-3 thriller, full of spirit and determination by both teams does give one a satsifaction that easy victories do not. In both games, not one player looked angry or dejected after the game, more beaten but unbowed, feeling proud. More of this should see the victories come sooner than later. <a class="txlink" href="0124pumas.html">more</a><br>

									An under-par BFC came up against a decent (though, in my view, still some way off their best) Sala and it was Sala who walked away with the spoils, leaving BFC in TML no man's land and rueing the unavailability of key players.. <a class="txlink" href="0123bfc.html">more</a><br>

									Happy New Year to all, and best wishes to footy lovers everywhere (except Man City fans).&nbsp;<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									Simply summed up. First half: bang, bang, bang.&nbsp; Second half: squeak, squeak, squeak.<br>
									&nbsp;<br>
									With a 3 goal 20 minute blitz in the first half Sala over-powered Zion in this&nbsp;basement battle&nbsp;and wrapped up the points early.&nbsp; Brookey, Toby and Sam&nbsp;plundered the goals.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0110sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>YC&amp;AC Saturday 9th January.</b> &nbsp;<br>
									<b>The Kit</b><br>
									Move over Leon Trotsky (aka the artist formerly known as Kevin Gray).<br>
									Eschewing the customary New Year's greeting a flustered BFC captain kicks off 2010 with: 'Al what's the worst thing you think I could have left behind?'<br>
									Wife: check. Kids: Check. Both of them. Normally Evans 'cleans' the kit (giving the BFC players that delightful odour of stale Marlboros which has been scientifically proven to boost the team's performances). Alas.<br>
									Upshot: BFC spend a frantic 20 minutes rifling through the lost-and-found at YCAC for spare shorts and socks. Kazuki Tadoroki has no shirt and contemplates bare-chestedness. 'Saco' Sakai tries on a pair of very smelly Hawaiian beach shirts. BFC look gay. <a class="txlink" href="0109bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Vags clashed with Hell Cats, Swiss clashed with Clash and the Clash clashed with the refs.&nbsp; Yes folks, a vast array of colour set against the dazzling streams of the Oi Dai Ni pitch markings were on full view this past Sunday at the New Year 7&rsquo;s tournament.&nbsp; Thankfully bibs were on hand to discriminate the teams and all was set for a day of exciting footy.<br>
