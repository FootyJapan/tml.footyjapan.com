									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 5th September</b><br>
										After a stern warning from the skipper not to&nbsp;be late for the first game of BFC's season, the skipper (and the kit) promptly missed the train and turned up late...and so it was business as usual&nbsp;as another BFC season got underway -&nbsp;bread and butter was&nbsp;back on the weekend menu, with&nbsp;the Saitama Jets serving up&nbsp;the best&nbsp;Hanno had to offer. Despite missing 6 regular defenders, BFC's line up looked pretty useful with no fewer than 4 TML debutantes coming into&nbsp;a side that had 10 midfielders on display, shirts tucked in 'n all. As we've come to expect from Jets they were up for it from the off and set about their task with the usual level of fitness and commitment. BFC soon settled into their rhythm though and were&nbsp;then dictating the pace of the game with long periods of possession.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With a few BFC chances going begging in the early stages, the possession paid off after about 20 minutes when, man of the match, Shockham Yamagishi beat a couple of defenders, thundered the ball into the box only for Saco to pop up with a back post bullet header giving the useful Jets keeper no chance: 1-0 BFC. New signing Darren 'I've been around a bit' Russell&nbsp;did question what Saco (the left back in a back three) was doing highest man up the pitch at 0-0, but Saco just turned up the volume on his super-size-sonys and scuttled back into position. More possession from BFC followed, more pressure, a few decent&nbsp;saves from the Jets keeper before Shockham wound his way through the Jets defence before blasting one into the net: 2-0 BFC, keeper no chance. The lad was on fire.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With a bench full&nbsp;of quality constant changes were made to the BFC ranks, perhaps unruffling the otherwise solid BFC defensive&nbsp;feathers which&nbsp;led to the best passage of play from Jets. But BFC were up to it with the midfield looking strong and committed and, despite Tepi having to pull off one excellent save, it was not long before BFC took control again. The second half ended with a goal for Duncan 'full backs&nbsp;beware'&nbsp;Walsh on his debut&nbsp;and a great header from&nbsp;Evans 'Why was&nbsp;I on the bench? Where were you all Summer?' Kunyuga. Final whistle 4-0&nbsp;and a deserved 3 points for a new look BFC.<br>
