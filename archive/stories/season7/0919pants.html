									<p><b>Misato, Saturday 19th September</b><br>
										Panthers continued their strong start to TML 7 with a hard fought victory against BEFC.&nbsp; After watching the late drama between El Diego and Dutch the game kicked off with a fairly strong wind blowing, typical Misato style.&nbsp; The pitch had surprisingly kept in decent shape despite the previous week&rsquo;s rain.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Both teams started slowly and the first 20 minutes were fairly even, BEFC were keeping the ball and passing it well.&nbsp; They had a few skilful midfielders and 2 quick strikers so we knew they would be dangerous.<br>
										Panthers got the first decisive break after about 15 minutes as Ben Cordier bustled through a few challenges from a long ball, which was carrying and causing problems for the BEFC backline in the wind. He slotted the ball past the keeper just inside the box.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										After that Panthers were on top and kept the ball in the opposition half, the wind was keeping the ball hanging in the air and the Panthers midfield were cleaning things up nicely. It was from a Panthers corner however that BEFC got firmly back in the game with a classic counter attack. Already after 3 games in division 2 the quality of the attacking players has stood out. Similar to Barbarians, BEFC had 2 strikers that could score a goal out of nothing.&nbsp; A clearance from the back put one of their strikers in behind the Panthers back 3 on the left.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At this point he still had a lot of work to do. He raced clear through on goal and kept ahead of the defender. His strike partner Alex made a great run square to his right, and as Sid came out of goal to narrow the angle he played a square ball and Alex had an open goal to put the ball into.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Game on and BEFC seemed really up for it at this point.&nbsp; Panthers showed great character to respond and about 10 minutes later Ben Cordier scored a screamer to put Panthers back on top.&nbsp; He rode one challenge on the edge of the box and running backwards it looked like he had lost control of the ball. Somehow on the turn he hit a first time shot which curled into the far top corner, the keeper did not move.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Panthers were on top now and soon after scored a great team goal. The ball was up in the air and Ben Cordier headed it back to Romen in the centre of the pitch. He hit a first time ball to Matt Lennon in the left back position - given time and space he was able to ping a great pass into the feet of Tom Thurman, who was causing a lot of problems for the BEFC back line. Tom played a first time pass into Ma, who up till this moment had a fairly quiet game. He dummied a shot which took 2 defenders out of the game and then hit a low shot into the near corner. 3-1 and some breathing room going into half-time.<br>
										Second half was tough as expected. It was now our turn to deal with the wind and as a result we switched to 4 at the back to give us a little more protection with just 1 striker left upfront. The half was an ongoing battle as BEFC pushed forward strongly. At the same time Panthers continued to be dangerous on the break and should have extended their lead &#150; Tom Thurman was clean through and his shot went into the side netting.&nbsp; Late on Ben Cordier also broke through on the left but couldn&rsquo;t pull the ball back far enough with Panthers lining up in the box.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Despite the pressure and possession in the Panthers half, BEFC could not make a breakthrough. The back 5 did a solid job, and the midfield worked hard in front of them.&nbsp; It was with around a minute of play left they did make a breakthrough &#150; Panthers lost possession cheaply at left back, allowing BEFC to cross and score.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										It would have been interesting if there was more time left but luckily we survived the final moments and won the game. Panthers were on the back foot more than I can remember compared to recent games and there were some great performances at the back, especially Alan at right back. Again we had a match winner in Ben Cordier and he was very effective playing the advanced midfield role,&nbsp; involved in all 3 goals.&nbsp; Also Tom Thurman had his best game of the season and was unlucky not to score.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With 4 changes from the Albion game we showed good strength in depth and hopefully can continue next Saturday against Swiss as we will need to rotate things again. BEFC will be up there this season for sure as they are well organised, can play good football through the midfield and the front 2 will be a handful.<br>
