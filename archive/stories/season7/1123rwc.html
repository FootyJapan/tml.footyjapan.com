						<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Monday 23rd November.</b><br>
							After a penalty victory in the cup it was a rather changed Clash team that took to the (perfectly sized and surfaced) pitch at Fukuda Denshi against free scoring Stoneds. The game ended 2-2 with Clash going 1-0 up then 2-1 down and equalizing shortly before the end.<br>
							Rob Keyworth came in for Kevin Green between the posts. Rees, England, Snaith and Kataoka were replaced by skipper Webster, Lee, Zollar, James, Taka and Kiku. Doug Lee played in defensive midfield surprisingly but Lee and Shiba played well at the beginning of the game against a classy Stoneds midfield. Webster and Thompson coped well at the back with Stoneds attacks ably supported by Hanamura and Doyno.<br>
							Building steadily from the back and with their tracksuit bottomed midfield maestro switching play at will and probing away at the Clash defence Stoneds looked ready to take the lead but for some well timed challenges and cut outs from the Clash backline. On a side note at this point I must point out in my best Brian Clough impersonation, &lsquo;Old fashioned though I maybe young men I do hate to see players in a supposedly proper match in a properly run league not wearing proper correct match kit. Doesn&rsquo;t matter how silkily you play you look a right pansy wearing tracksuit bottoms in a football match not to mention gloves, and these scarf like things. Bloomers and handbags next&rsquo;. Back to the game and Clash though not renowned for being pansies are sadly not known for their pretty football either but were playing nicely in patches with James doing his best to hold the ball up and play others in and Shiba also switching play and orchestrating things after Lee had broken down play well time after time. So it was on a breakaway that Clash took the lead with a ball falling to the number 8 who cut inside and slid a ball to Cosco to hammer home. 1-0 to Jekyll.<br>
							After a few substitutions Clash turned into the more familiar Edward Hyde team of the last couple of seasons with division in the ranks. Andy Drought who had been in good form against Shane despite an early knock last outing looked like he had left his pedals on after his 50 mile up and down hill cycle before this match. He seemed to think he was playing for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as he tonked a few wild balls to the Invisible Man. Stoneds came back into the match as Clash started to argue with each other yet it was Clash who had a chance to go further ahead. James rounded the keeper but was not able to beat the man on the line.<br>
							At halftime it might have been Clash that were one nil down by the looks on their faces and body language and despite a stern halftime talking to the second half started a little raggedly too. Though there were still some chances for Clash it was Stoneds who again with alternating attacking play to either wing were causing problems and the Clash defence was looking slightly less assured as some clearances were sliced. Stoneds equalized with an uncharacteristic hit and hope ball over the top and Wing Commander Webster one of the larger players on the field was pushed to the floor by a diminutive Stoneds striker who scored past Rob Keyworth. 1-1! As Clash continued to attack mostly down the right wing but failed to get their crosses in Stoneds kept up their passing from the back and through the ranks but again succeeded to score through a hopeful long ball. Thompson failed to clear and the Stoneds player ran through to slide past Rob. 2-1 to the now Hyde like Stoneds and things looking grim for Clash who were playing more and more like an aged Allan Quartermain. <br>
							With not long left however Go Murano with the wind whistling through his gap toothed grimace (good on him for having one of his teeth knocked out to better fit into the gnarly Clash team) chased down a seemingly lost cause. A Stoneds defender thought you could hold a player off while a few yards away from the ball and a freekick was given to Clash on the left side of the box near the byline. Jin Shiba crossed cleanly to the backpost and with no big game hunters about it was the Clash&rsquo;s bearded vegetarian skipper Captain Nemo, sorry, WC Webster who exacted some revenge with the simplest of backpost headers. 2-2 was the final score despite a last minute breakaway by Clash that broke down with Go having perhaps too many options as he broke free into space.<br>
