												<td><P><B>30th Oct, YCAC. </B>It was a wet and miserable day as Barbarians headed towards Yokohama
hoping that the rain would not cancel their game against KGFC. Whilst
rain did not stop play it certainly dampened down the Barbarians
performance<BR><BR>

Starting line up was Ian in goal, Fred & Fergs in central defence with
Kaz & Hideki making up the back line, midfield was Richard C, Alex
Durning, John Stokes & Alex Wright, with our third Alex, Red Alex up
front alongside Muramoto-san, a reliable sub in Ian Pulford was on hand
<BR><BR>
KGFC were one of those sides the BaBa have struggled with all season,
all Japanese, young and fast and well practised in the art of passing a
ball. This was going to be no different with KGFC immediately opening up
the attack and fierce defending and keeping saving BaBas on countless
occasions in the first 25 mins. Inevitably a breakthrough was finally
made and a breakdown in BaBas midfield gave the ball back to KGFC who
finished off some decent passing with a well taken shot for a 1-0 lead.
BaBas held out till half time with a few more scares but hardly a real
chance of their own other than a possible penalty call as Alex W was
brought down early in the game<BR><BR>

The second half looked better for BaBas right from the off, playing with
the wind on their backs BaBas had the better of the opening 10 minutes,
getting their first corner of the game and certainly looking more
threatening. KGFC came back into the game soon after that and were once
again creating chances that the defence were just managing to contain.
As the game entered the final 15 minutes BaBas pushed harder trying to
find an opening leaving inevitable gaps in the midfield, one of which
was exploited by KGFC with a fine run from midfield, cutting in from the
right to beat Ian at the near post<BR><BR>

BaBas again pushed forward but with two free kicks from Freddie (aka NOT
Platini) being the best of our chances didn't really threaten the KGFC
goal. The complete git of a keeper did get threatened from both Richard
C and Red Alex but this was more verbal and physical than any real
intent on his clean sheet<BR><BR>

In the last 15 minutes Ian the keeper showed his worth with two fine
short range stops that should have gone in but for his excellent keeping
and he capped his performance with a great penalty save in the dying
minutes as Fred was judged to have handled the ball<BR><BR>

All in all a dissapointing day with the damp conditions leaving the
BaBas attack fizzling rather than sparkling<BR><BR>
