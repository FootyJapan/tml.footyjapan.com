												<td><P><B>10th Jan St Mary's. Swiss Kickers 5 France FC 1.</B><BR>
												A solid performance by the Swiss systematically took apart a tenacious 
France FC team, in a 5-1 win at St. Mary's last Saturday in the second game 
of the brand new Tokyo Metropolis League. The French without their regular 
keeper Elliot borrowed the Hibs keeper for the first half of the game, a 
decision that could've created early  controversy in this embryonic league, 
had the result gone France's way and in the first 30 minutes, there was 
every chance it could.<BR><BR>

France went on the offensive from the whistle and in the early stages of the 
first half were connecting some good passes and holding onto the ball 
effectively in midfield. They had a couple of good chances early on with 
shots firing just wide or over, but the Swiss - clearly a tad leg heavy 
after the New Year festivities - soon took control of the situation with 
solid defending by Kirk and Damon at the back. Aoki, playing in his usual 
wide role was being picked out from the back and was linking expertly with a 
midfield and strike force, that became noticeably more mobile as time went 
on.<BR><BR>

At half time the Hibs keeper changed for a France FC outfield player and it 
took just seconds for Karl to break the deadlock. The second half was a 
different story as Yuu pushed forward setting up at least two of the Swiss 
goals, including a text book header by Kirk at the back post after swinging 
the ball in from a corner.
<BR><BR>
The French did score one consolation goal, but really looked like a 
different team in the second half and never looked like recovering after 
conceding the second of five Swiss goals. The Swiss, even with regular 
strikers Ian and Phil missing still looked like a formidable outfit and will 
definitely be THE team to beat in this new league.<BR><BR>
