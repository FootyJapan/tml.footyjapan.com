				</table>The outcome of the match was settled after only 3 minutes of the first half played. Shane striker Paul James, maiking a good run down the wing 
												and flighting over a high ball which was brilliantly headed in by his partner up front, James Knight. <BR><BR>
												After this goal the match turned into more of a basketball match. Turtle being the offense and Shane the defence. Turtle mounted charge after 
												charge, but Shane manned the barricades and defended for the most part with aplomb. <BR><BR>
												Turtle shot from just about every angle and distance over 20 yards but to no avail. And so it ended with a 1-0 win for Shane; however there 
												was a certain amount of luck involved in Shane's victory but a great deal of spirit and endeavour. <BR><BR>
												Shane will go on to the next game looking for just a point, whereas the unfortunate Turtle FC will have to play the waiting game.<BR><BR>
