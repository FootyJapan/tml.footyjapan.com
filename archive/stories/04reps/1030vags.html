														<h2>Vags miss golden chance to retrieve points in cold day in Saitama</h2>

												<td><P><B>00th Oct, Nodai. </B>It was so cold and wet up in the northern wastes of Saitama that no one wanted to get changed, al fresco, until the 
												opposition Jets were lined up and ready on the pitch a minute before kick-off. But a rapid rain-lashed switch into football strips later and the
												 Vags were ready to go. The game started and continued for most of the half with the Jets fairly well in control with good passing from their four 
												 confident full-backs who distributed to both wings with imaginative passes. (This writer suspects that the Jets play on the Nodai zippy grass 
												 pitch quite a lot, whereas the Vags normally get to play on dirt most of the year round.) Saying that, the game was of genuinely good quality 
												 with some nice football from both sides, with Lyndsey in particular once again running all over the place, collecting the ball and using it well. 
												 One move I believe started with Lyndsay running down the right, providing to Sid who made a perfect pass onto the feet of the unguarded Alex S 
												 whose low shot from six yards was just grasped by the Jets keeper. This was to be the only chance for the Vags in the first half. Meanwhile the 
												 Jets used their superior possession to build several chances, leading to a couple of goal line clearances  from Cameron and Co, as well as a fine 
												 long shot which scraped the Vags bar and flew over. It was nil-nil at half time.<BR><BR>
												 The second period was much better from the Vags and more or less an equal match all round, with the ball changing hands rapidly with each tackle 
												 and interception. The Vags defence was excellent in this period, with solid stuff from Jason and on-loan Thierry and a series of slide tackles 
												 from Alex B. It was early on at this time however, that a high Jets cross from the right of the area left outstanding keeper Taylor in two minds 
												 whether to run out and catch or stand on the line and wait, resulting in him being intermediate between the two choices when the Jets' looping 
												 header arched over and dropped into the empty net for 1-0. This brought the so-far unbeaten Vags to life with some great battling. Still there 
												 were very few shots on goal during the half, until a fair tackle from Ged on a stray Jets forward who was heading towards the corner flag led 
												 to the Jets being awarded a penalty instead of a free kick at most, presumably because the goal area markings were completely obliterated and 
												 no one knew where the tackle occurred. It was a bad decision from the otherwise steady ref. In any case, it came to nothing as the penalty flew 
												 wide as well as over. From then on, the Vags kept at it looking for a reply, and either Lyndsey or Sid came close with a just-over bullet header 
												 from a precise Joel corner. But it was in the final minute when all the hard work seemed to pay off, when Sid was shirt-tugged over while this 
												 time definitely in the box. Sid placed the ball on the spot, fired low, and, when the keeper parried, half the Vags were in the box looking for 
												 the rebound which the Jets keeper managed to save again from Alex S.<BR><BR>
												 Quite a hard-luck story for the extended-squad Vags who played very well with just about everyone doing 20 mins as a sub in the cold and rain.
