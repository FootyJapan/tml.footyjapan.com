												<td><P><B>Sun December 12th 2004, YC&amp;AC. </B>The drive down from Tokyo to YCAC was rather foreboding as 2 Swiss had cancelled just before departure and the rain starting coming down quite hard as we were passing lovely Kawasaki. Fortunately, the rain never made it to the YCAC and we were able to start in the cold and gray. Kick-off at 10 on a brisk morning, the YCAC seemed a little bit more up for it at the start, winning more loose balls and always going in hard on the challenge. The Swiss clearly aren't comfortable on the hard, bouncy, grass and the YCAC know how to play on it, long balls from the back or crosses in from Damien on the left. On this day, YCAC's two leading scorers were not to be seen at the start with PJ Park having picked up 3 yellow cards and Joe Takeda arriving a little late resulting in a lost starting place. This meant there was a new tandem up front for the YCAC and there weren't many balls getting through the taller, well organized, Swiss defense. The long balls kept coming but weren't too productive - one or two dangerous crosses and one poor clearance fell to Damien to bang over the bar in spite of being clear. Eventually the Swiss started settling and getting some passes around the field which meant more opportunities. Three or 4 corner kicks were sent in dangerously with Dave Pratt just missing one close header (how he missed from 3 yards out is a mystery) and Trevor coming up short as well. Karl Hahne had a nice 20 meter shot saved by the keeper diving to his right. Amidst a lot of pressure, Steve Taw marshaled a firm defense and held the Swiss forwards at bay. That was until a good move by Ian to pull away from his marker, turning in from the right. The ball was then actually taken off him by Dave Spiers who passed it first time the opposite direction to Dave Pratt who ran into the box unmarked. Dave settled and smacked it by the keeper for a 1-0 lead. A little bit of skill made the difference with two battling sides.
<BR><BR>The second half was more of the same with the YCAC still trying to find out where the forwards wanted the ball and how to link up with the midfield. The Swiss began to show a little more composure and started to include Yuji on the left as an attacking option and Ian tried to raise it a notch as well. The passes started to come together and some good moves resulted, unfortunately, a solid YCAC defense continued to frustrate both Ian and Karl. That was true until 20 minutes into the 2nd half, Steve Taw misjudged a bouncing ball, Ian just got a touch to knock it away and turn towards goal. He then let go with a left footed shot that went into the lower right hand corner. 2-0 to the Swiss which appeared to be a comfortable position. That was until just a couple of minutes later when the Swiss could not clear a bouncing ball in their box, one of the YCAC's young forwards got a nice turn and smacked one right on target. Peter Pauli in goal for the Swiss either took it on the face or just deflected it with his hands over the bar (he says it was ‘good positioning') but it was very lucky the YCAC didn't pull one back. The YCAC tried to push forward more through Joe Takeda but it seemed to be a lack of organization up front which let them down with the Swiss back four intact. Going the other way, as the YCAC pushed, more opportunities fell to the Swiss. Unfortunately, most of them fell to Dave Spiers who continuously shot over the bar from 12 - 25 meters which meant the final score stayed unchanged.
<BR><BR>It was nice to beat the team that edged us last season but there is still a long way to go in the league and a chance for the YCAC to take revenge later on. Well played to all and thanks to Kazu who in addition to his kids on the sidelines, had a lot of parenting to do on the pitch as well.
