												<td><P><B>20th Sept, OiFuto 2. </B>A game of football nearly broke out on Monday night as Barbarians
  extended their unbeaten run by huffing and puffing to a hard fought and
  slightly disappointing 1-1 draw with The Vags on a surface at Oi Futo
  which could never be described as being conducive to good football.<BR><BR>

  The 1st half, which was played at a frenetic pace, rarely saw the ball on
  the ground with the ever reliable Fergy in defence and Mickey and Nick in
  midfield having to forget all thoughts of the champagne football of which
  they are capable and instead concentrate on a private game of head tennis
  with their opposite numbers in between each goal kick and free kick.
  Consequently chances and the ball actually being in play were a rarity.
  John Stokes came the closest to breaking the deadlock with a powerful
  header from a perfectly flighted Alex Arvakiants corner. At the other end
  Senoo prevented a certain goal with a fantastic last ditch blocking
  tackle on a Vags striker only 6 yards from goal.<BR><BR>

  Barbarians opened the 2nd half with a concentrated effort to play the
  ball on the ground and to the strength of their strikers. They were
  rewarded with their best spell of the game. Alex Durning opened the
  scoring with a well placed free kick into the far corner, the goalkeeper
  undoubtedly being deceived by the pace on the ball and the onrushing Alex
  Wright. Hideki and Kaneko were linking well on the right hand side,
  Austin was finding space on the left and Yusuke looked dangerous every
  time he ran with the ball, narrowly missing the outside of the right hand
  post with a dipping half volley from 25 yards out. Vagabonds can feel
  aggrieved that their supremacy during this period did not translate into
  more goals but greater nous will need to be shown in the future if they
  are not to again be undone by a well-organized offside trap.<BR><BR>

  Freddy Delsaux, who some say is the best striker of a dead ball in The
  Metropolis League, could not quite replicate the power and accuracy of
  his goal kicks in his free kicks coming close on 3 occasions but each
  time committing the cardinal error of not forcing the goalkeeper to make
  a save.<BR><BR>

  The Vags weathered the storm and showed their strength of character by
  equalizing with 10 minutes to go through a fine individual effort by
  their young right winger Alex Sahara who ran onto a through ball and
  teased the Barbarians defence before cutting inside onto his left foot to
  fire a strong swerving shot through the despairing grasp of Ian who
  otherwise had a flawless game in goal.<BR><BR>

  Both sides had half chances to win it near the end.<BR><BR>

  The post match analysis included the cliché more perspiration than
  inspiration. Never has a truer word been said.<BR><BR>
