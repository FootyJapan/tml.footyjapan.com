												<td><P><B>23rd Oct, OiFuto 2. </B>A brisk Tuesday evening on the astroturf, floodlit pitch at Oi Futo saw the Barbarians face 
												the familiar faces of the Canto Celts. Friendships off the pitch were put aside as the two sides fought, sometimes quite 
												literally, for the TML regulation 80 minutes. The Babas, managing to put together more than 10 men for the first time in 3 matches, were determined not to be beaten again.

<BR><BR>The Celts came out strong, and dominated possession and chances for the first ten minutes. The Babas seemed to be chasing shadows at times, and stand in keeper Okubo-san had his work cut out. Okubo-san, an experienced keeper making his first start for the Babas, showed safe hands on a number of occasions, and came off his line quickly when required. But the deadlock was broken on 10 minutes. A long sweeping ball from left to right saw Celts midfielder Damo (no stranger to the Babas), collect the ball up against Muramoto on the right hand corner of the box. A poor first touch, but luckily for the Celts the ball bounce away from Muramoto. Damo applied the finish, with the Okubo having no chance. 0-1.

<BR><BR>As the half stretched, chances were few and far between. Perhaps unsurprisingly between these two sides, strong challenges were going in all over the pitch. The fitness of the aggressive Celts gave them the edge and they still dominated most of the play. But Ferg and Alex A marshalled the defence expertly, playing in only their second game together. Alex W started to man mark the Celts no. 18, their most creative midfielder, and the tide seemed to turn a little. Substitutions were made on the 20 minute mark, and the tide started to turn. Hideki started to make some driving runs down the right, John Stokes started to make some telling passes from midway inside the Babas half, and the team managed to hold possession for the first time in the match. Austin and Rouven in particular keeping the ball well. The half ended with a succession of corners for the Babas, but alas, no clear chances.

<BR><BR>The second half started as the first ended. The Babas kept possession and it was clear that the Celts were beginning to get frustrated. A series of substitutions on their side seemed to bring on a few weaker players, and the Babas were taking advantage. The best chance however still fell to the Celts. A 35 yard screamer from the right midifielder taking everyone by surprise except perhaps Okubo-san, who expertly punched the top corner bound strike over the bar for a corner. A fantastic save made to look easy!

<BR><BR>The Celts frustration was obvious as the Babas continued to take control. 20 minutes to go and another series of substitutions gave the Babas a further lift. Alex D had a fantastic free kick from the right hand side touched round the post. A succession of corners bounced around in the box, but no-one could get a strike on the ball. Alex D again broke away, this time on the left with an expert back heel through the legs of the defender. But the covering centre back managed to force the ball out of play. An opportunity for a long range strike was called by Ferg, but hit by John and went disappointingly wide. Dennis kept running the defenders wide, but the opportunities in the middle kept drifting away. The Celts midfield simply fell apart, but disappointingly for the Babas, their defence was holding strong. Ferg and Alex A, devoid of any defensive duties, had space to push forward in an attempt to help the team get an equaliser.

<BR><BR>But alas the goal never arrived. The Celts held on to the final whistle, and the Babas losing streak continues. Surely someone is going to be on the end of a Babas back lash soon?

<BR><BR>And finally, a quick word from the TML: The referee was very impressed by both teams saying, “the game between Kanto Celts and Barbarians was extremely competitive and played with great spirit and fairness. No complaints were heard throughout the game and everybody shook hands at the end. This is how football should be played and I think both teams deserve a pat on the back”.

<BR><BR>Well done all.


<BR>Final score: 0-1.
<BR>Man of the match: Okubo-san (fantastic goalkeeping)
