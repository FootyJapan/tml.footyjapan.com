														<h2>BARBARIANS SCHMOKE THE DUTCH!</h2>

												<td><P><B>Sat December 11th 2004, YC&amp;AC. </B>  a bitter saturday night in the middle of nowheresville drew the crowds;
(and the players.....eventually...ahem; alex a) to this potentially dangerous
encounter for us vs close to league leaders the dutch embassy
   the baba's were forced to use their away strip of 'gaggle of
multicolours' due to the fact that both teams actually choose to play in
shocking orange....<BR>
   after a quick rummage the baba's were decked out in 3 or 4 celtic hoops;
a smattering of real madrid, a lone blue chelsea top, france away, positive
i spotted an old spain top at one point and a horrendous fluorescent keeper
jersey circa 1990.<BR>
   confusion reigned for the first 10 minutes as members of the barbarians
guided pin-point passes to the pegs of the grateful orange tops for possibly
the first time this season...taking the ball in their stride the japanese
dutch forwards attacked the defence but were forced to let loose from
outside the danger area, more often than not the ball failing to trouble the
bespectacled ian in between the uprights; but when he was called into action
the no. 1 reacted like a cat on heat and blocking superbly from extreme
close less than point blank range...ensuring the scoreline remained at
stalemate<BR>
   the dutch continued to run at the perplexed baba's; managing to find a
gap between the second hand sieve like defence... just as the ball was about
to be propelled goalwardbound; enter stage left alex a...'russian' back to put
a stop to any though<BR>ts of a shot on goal; a natural centre defender if ever
there was one
   then suddenly half-way through the first half the tide decided to turn
around and started to 'big-up' the baba's as clarke let rip from 35 yards
(just outside the box); taking a slight deflection along the way the ball
wrongfooted the hapless dutch keeper and after an agonizing wait it ended up
bursting the back of the net...1-0 to the baba's
   after a hazy start we were finally beginning to oil<BR> ourselves up; senno
getting amongst it; fred' s amazing distribution of the ball; hiro the real
'flying dutchman' up front and in particular our very own american hardman
johnny mac putting the wind(mill) up the dutch back marker; he loves a chase
that boy and caused the dutch defence to panic amongst themselves; alex w.
was also able to "pass the dutchie on the left hand side" a few times when
he decided to stop ice skating...<BR>
   but the dutch continued to apply pressure but still couldnt get close
enough to get on the scoresheet; again resulting to long range
efforts...reports of the no. 13 for the opposition (their top marksman this
season with 10 goals); after his 7th unsuccessful attempt on goal commenting
"i couldn't score in an amsterdam brothel with a fistful of guilders" were
unfounded<BR><BR>
   into the second installment of this gripping fixture and after the
halftime oranges baba's continued to be the dominatrix; but for a brief
shaky moment when fergie attempted to clear the ball off his own goal line
with his wee pert posterior....cue fits of giggles; who needs biftas when
you have fergie around?<BR>
   with both teams running low on energy; big john stokes started holding
the ball (with his feet of course) in the centre of the pitch; painting
images of frustration on the faces of the opposition; then a searching ball
from fred (i think) found the physical johnny mac up front; only for him to
be clattered as he was about to romp home; no doubt penalty sir!
   john stokes then stepped up and cooly slotted home from 12 yards to
double (dutch) the baba's lead<BR>
   just 5 minutes later ferg parted their defence
like a machetted coconut to pick out clarke who unleashed an unstoppable
shot from an impossibly ridiculous angle outside the box to make it san -
zero!<BR>
   at the fag-end of the match an amazing tip over the baba's bar protected
the 3-0 lead...unfortunately the save in question came from level headed
left back austin who left the ref no option but to send him packing and to
congratulate him on a fine stop...ian beware!<BR>
   the resulting penalty hit the post; another dramatic event in this
scintillating televised match; the ppv customers were certainly getting their
moneys worth...the clock duly ran out to award us with a fully deserved 3
points; all in all an amster-damn fine performance from the men in white and
green hoops, blue, white and red
   after an iffy start to the campaign the barbarians are beginning to show
they have great bouncebackability

<BR>man of the match; clarke... 2 goals despite a bout of the flu; robbed of a
certain hat-trick after he was given offside in his own half when through
with just the keeper to beat....in the post match interview he said he was
"over the moon...a-choo" with his performance...

<BR>man of the pre-match; employee of lawson...dressed head to toe in ridiculous
reindeer get-up...almost as funny as fergies arse
