												<td><P><B>16th May Oi Futo Dai Ni. </B>This match was played by two teams with a point to prove to themselves and the rest of the league. 
												After a pretty disappointing TML season both teams need to do well in the Japan Cup. Thus began one of the games of the season. <BR><BR>
												The game was played in pretty dreary conditions and on a surface which does not forgive mistakes on the ball. As the first half commenced Shane to an early lead scoring in only the second 
												minute. The opening goal resulted from an excellent volley from Richard. <BR>
												The lead didn't last that long though. The Celts pulled back with a blockbuster of a shot from 30 yards out. However, Shane started to make headway and their efforts were rewarded with 
												two well taken goals from winger/forward James Knight. <BR>
												As the half wore on the Celts exerted more pressure and struck back with two great shots. <BR><BR>
												The second half started well for Shane, as they came racing out of the blocks with two goals early in the second period from Paul James and Richard for a second time, both goals executed 
												with great precision. This was probably Shanes best period of the match and the celts were being run ragged at this point. However the Celts really started to put some effort into their 
												play and it was their turn to dominate. <BR>
												This period of domination resulted in another great goal for the Celts. For the last 10 minutes the Celts worked like a team possessed and very nearly levelled it in the last minute 
												with a header whistling past the post. <BR><BR>
												Overall both teams played well, but Shane probably just deserved it on chances created. Regardless of the result both teams can give themselves a very heavy pat on the back. A superb 
												spectacle of footie. <BR><BR>
												Final score Shane 5 Celts 4.<BR><BR>
