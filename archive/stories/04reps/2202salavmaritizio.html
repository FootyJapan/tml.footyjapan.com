												<td><P><B>22nd Jan OiFuto. Sala FC 3 - 1 Maritzio FC  (1-0) (2-1).</B><BR>
												Very dusty park with high winds at Oifuto. Sala won the toss and chose the wind advantage for the first half. After a lot of hard work in the first twenty minutes with several shots on goal Sala were in good control of the match and gave Maritzio few chances if any. Around the 30 minute mark, Sala playing a first time (4-4-1-1) formation witrh Brian Gallagher up front as the target man with Jodey behind him ready to get the lay off it was Brian who scored the first goal with a nice chest down with his back to goal and quick turn to give himself enough space to get in a very hard and straight shot to the keepers top left hand side. 1-0 Sala.<BR>
												More chances followed but the first half ended up 1-0.<BR><BR>
												Second half saw a few changes in personnel only keeping the same formation. Tackling got harder from Maritzio as they tried to get back into the game. A few messy ones, a few unseen and a bit of tension in the midfield. No bookings though and the game went Salas way again after Naoki Ogasawara placed in a nice shot after some good team play. A happy man. 2-0 Sala.<BR><BR>
												<BR>Again Maritzio tried to dig deep and it paid off with a neat goal a five to ten minutes later. (2-1). 
												<BR><BR>Sala then upped the tempo and calmed the players back to playing neat passing football. Great teamwork paid off when ten minutes from time another goal came from Naoki as the boys upfront and in midfield pushed on to cause trouble in the Maritzio 18 yard box. (3-1).
												<BR><BR>Ten more minutes to be played and all the life was out of Maritzio as Sala held it tight and held their composure to seal the victory. Final score (3-1). 
												<BR><BR>Fair Play to Sala with no BOOKINGS, Maritzio unlucky with 1 Yellow for dissent.
