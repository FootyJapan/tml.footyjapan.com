														<h2>BARBARIANS GET 1st WIN.</h2>

												<td><P><B>Sun November 28th 2004, YC&amp;AC. </B>Yokohama was treated to some fantastic weather on the final weekend of November. Almost perfect weather conditions were sadly not matched by the quality of the very uneven YCAC pitch. The match of the day pitched two of the two teams struggling at the wrong end of TML league division 2 - The Barbarians and YCAC 2nds. Both badly needed a win, and both probably had this game down as a "banker". Defeat for either side would surely signal a long struggle to avoid finishing bottom.

<BR><BR>Baba's were buoyed by the fact that they had a starting eleven for the second week in a row. Fantastic. But a last minute drop out did mean there were no substitutes. Not fantastic. Pre-match gossip spoke of YCAC not having a goalkeeper, so the Babas were in confident mood. And indeed they came out of the traps very fast. The first 20 minutes saw the Babas dominate the whole playing field, with YCAC struggling to get out of their own half. After only 5 minutes, a long cross from the right saw Hideki running in to chest the ball out of the path of the goalkeeper, and into an open net. He applied the tap in, and the Babas led 1-0. On the quarter hour mark, a corner was played in from the right, bounced about before Alex W stuck a right foot volley from 16 yards. Unluckily it bounced of the wrong side of the keeper's right hand post. The Babas were on fire!

<BR><BR>Alex A and Ferg had little to do, and at some points, so advanced was he, that it seemed like Ferg was running the midfield! But there were a few warning signs. Alex W neglected to pick up the "short rotund elderly" right winger from YCAC, and was very nearly embarrassed as he connected with a right wing cross to head just wide. A close call.

<BR><BR>Muramoto and John M continued to soldier on up front (John benefited by 48 hours rest, recovering from a monster party in Las Vegas). Long balls over the top were dutifully chased down, and the babas kept won a string of corners and throw ins deep in opposition territory. But the second goal was slow in coming, and the potential collapse of YCAC failed to materialise. This seemed to provide them with a little hope, and in the final 10 minutes of the first half, they started to play a little more football. Babas Hard man Austin got involved in a few challenges, and following a pretty obvious dive, he was right in there - shoving, screaming, intimidating - That boy is one of a kind! No cards were shown, but the game was beginning to get an edge. Just when they thought is wasn't going to come, the Babas got their second five minutes before the break. A long ball over the top was touched on, and chased down by Alex W. He seemed to have little chance as two defenders and the goal keeper converged on the high ball, but indecision by the defence let Alex in between the two defenders. The goal keeper made a last ditch attempt to clear the ball, but only succeeded in hitting the ball off Alex's chest. A collection of goal keeper, attacker and defender fell in a small pile as the ball rolled slowly over the line. A classic, or as Ferg would say "Roy of the Rovers"! Alex's cries of a damaged right hand were quickly stifled by his team mates, as he returned to the centre circle. 2-0.

<BR><BR>The second half was an entirely different affair. YCAC brought on some strong substitutions, and found a lot more width. All 4 Babas defenders had to be on top form, Austin in particular showing great running on the left. Sato commanded his box well, taking a number of key catches from corners. After a promising first half, and returning for his first game in quite a while, Akio was struggling to assert his usual control. John Stokes was having having to apply a little "physical finesse" to the crowded midfield in order to keep YCAC from getting back into the game. A number of breakaways saw the Babas nearly collect a third, but the ball just wouldn't run for them.

<BR><BR>With 5 minutes left on the clock YCAC were back in it. A freekick outside the box was chipped in, and pushed away by Kaz. But the defensive line waiting on the 18 yard line failed to react quickly enough, and the rebound was smashed past the keeper by the advancing YCAC striker. 2-1. A nervy last 5 minutes saw no chances created, and the Babas held on for a 2-1 victory. Their first in a quite some time, and the team must now hope that the tide is turning. 

<BR><BR>
<BR>Final score: 2-1.
<BR>Man of the match: Austin (Great solo defending on the left in a tough second half, not helped as Alex W seemed to run out of steam in the final 20 minutes.)
