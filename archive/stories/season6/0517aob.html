									<p><b>Sagamisansen, Sunday, May 17th</b><br>
										&quot;Blow winds,and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!<br>
										You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br>
										Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!<br>
										Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!<br>
										Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:<br>
										I tax you not, you elements, with unkindness;<br>
										I never gave you kingdom, called you children,<br>
										You owe me no subscription: then, let fall<br>
										Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,&nbsp;<br>
										A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man<br>
										Standing shivering between the goalposts,<br>
										Several miles from Ebina station.&quot;<br>
										<br>
										Obviously the raving madness referred to in the title is the insane idea of trying to play a game of football with a 50 mile-an-hour hurricanoe blowing almost straight down the field carrying a limitless cargo of horizontal rain that started as fine as an aerosol spray, gained enough strength during the first half to stab more needles into your arms and legs than even the most voracious smack addict could ever wish for, and in the second half - well, I've no idea: it was blowing so hard into my eyes I had no chance to look up and see. But as the sportswriter's venerable clich&eacute; says, it was the same for both sides, and it was the Robert Walters Clash who survived it better than the Albion Old Boys to depart the sodden scene at Sagamisansen with a much-needed 3-1 win.<br>
										<br>
										With the storm doing its best to blow one set of goalposts into the other, the choice of ends was always going to be crucial. Having won the toss, Old Boys Silver Supremo Karl Twohig seemed set on playing into the wind in the first half, but your reporter's five decades of footballing experience insisted that we should take the advantage of the elements while it was there - who could know if it'd be blowing the same way in the second half, or blowing at all. As it turned out it it was twenty miles an hour and twenty million litres worse in the second half - good call, Tel.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										So the Old Boys played the first half with more wind behind them than the finalists in the World Cabbage-Eating Contest, but despite a lot of farting around in the Clash half of the pitch the Albion were unable to turn their territorial advantage into goals. Failure to get a lead to defend in the second half would have been bad enough, but the Old Boys made things worse for themselves by conceding a soft goal on a rare Clash breakaway - not once, but twice in a very forgettable first half.<br>
										<br>
										With the Old Boys having no specialist keeper to call on for this game, skipper George Pel&eacute; Clarkson had nobly volunteered to do the job, but his lack of experience in the position didn't bode well for the siege that the Old Boys were surely about to endure. So your reporter, who had been a schoolboy custodian in the days when flat caps and woolly sweaters were de rigeur and at an age when touching the eight-foot high crossbar from a standing jump was the pinnacle of athletic achievement, offered to take over for the second half. For me it was not so much a tactical switch, more an opportunity to get hold of a couple of extra layers of clothing, and even if they did add another ten kilos to my already ample body weight, the long sleeves and long pants did offer some welcome protection from The Attack Of The High-Speed Needles. As it turned out, the expected siege never really materialized. I did have to make a couple of stops, the kind of diving save that should be accompanied by a lumberjack on the touchline screaming &quot;TIMBERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!&quot;, and with every hurricane-powered Clash shot that missed the target requiring the ball to be retrieved from several hundred yards away, I did end up doing more running than I would have done playing outfield, but bizarrely it was the Old Boys who had slightly more of the ball in the second half, although the steadily worsening conditions ensured that goal chances were few. The Old Boys gave themselves a glimmer of hope when South American guest star Ricardo knocked in a free kick, but not for long, as the Clash bundled one over the line from a corner to restore the two-goal advantage which they held onto till the final whistle sent everyone scurrying for the warmth and shelter of the park office.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										For the Old Boys this could easily have degenerated into a repeat of the weary capitulation against Zion, so they&nbsp;can be pleased with the way they battled back in the second half, and even though the defeat leaves them&nbsp;with just one point taken from the last fifteen on offer they'll be looking to get a full-strength squad out - no excuses accepted, geezers - to finish on a high note in the season finale against&nbsp;already-promoted FC International. For their part the Clash can be very pleased with the outcome of their battle against the elements.&nbsp;Starting the game in a relegation position, they were really up for this one, and if they play with the same spirit and energy in their last two games I can't see them going down - on the basis of their two performances against the Old Boys they certainly don't deserve to. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										On the long train ride back to civilization there was much musing about the injustice and indignity of guys our age being forced to endure the vicissitudes of storm, flood, blizzard and gale in the way we have since being slung out of our Little Eden at St Mary's. It put me in mind of the coda to the story of Lear and Gloucester's raving madness on the blasted heath, where Edgar Duke of Albany looks down on the aged corpses and observes:<br>
										<br>
										&quot;The oldest hath borne most: those that are young,<br>
										Shall never see so much, nor live so long.&quot; <br>
