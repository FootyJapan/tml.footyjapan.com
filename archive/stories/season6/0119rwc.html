									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, January 19th</b><br>
										After trailing 4-1 at half time, the Clash fought back to 4-4 only for the Barbarians to snatch victory in the closing minutes.  <br>
										<br>
										On a fresh January afternoon at Fukuda Denshi the Barbarians opened the scoring midway through the first half when a solid shot from outside the box found its way in to the Clash goal.  Kevin Green, in goal for the Clash, got a decent hand on the ball, however the power of the shot was enough to continue the ball's trajectory in to the roof of the net.<br>
										<br>
										Despite the goal the teams remained evenly matched, although neither side was able to carve out any clear-cut chances.  <br>
										<br>
										Eventually some sustained pressure from the Clash forwards was rewarded when Yasuyuki Kataoka coolly finished off a flowing move from close range after the ball had been pulled back from the bi-line. With ten minutes left of the first half, 1-1 was a fair reflection of the game.  However a bizarre series of events just before the break appeared to make the Barbarians certainties for victory.  <br>
										<br>
										First, a speculative shot from outside the box was half blocked by Clash centre back Dave Doyno.  The resulting deflection off Doyno's thigh sent the ball high in to the air, spinning and dipping in a cruel arch over the stranded keeper.  Almost immediately after the game was restarted, a suicidal ball played across the Clash's box allowed for a clear run on goal and no mistake was made by the Barbarian forwards.<br>
										<br>
										Finally, to end an incident packed ten minutes, the Barbarians completed a fine move when the ball was headed in at the back post.<br>
										<br>
										At half time the odds of a successful Clash fight back were extremely long.  However as the second half started it appeared that nobody in the Clash team had realised that this game was supposed to be over. The Clash's renewed vigour was swiftly rewarded when Rafa Collela, making an unexpected return to lead the attack, surged in to the area and was brought down by the Barbarians' keeper.  Jin Shiba made no mistake from the spot, driving the penalty low, hard and to the right of the goalkeeper.<br>
										<br>
										Yasayuki soon after reduced the deficit to just one goal.  Cutting back into the box from the left, then shooting beyond keeper's grasp, the ball nestled in the left-hand corner of the net. <br>
										<br>
										The fight back continued when Rafa made up an enormous amount of ground to pounce on a loose bouncing ball, heading it over the advancing keeper to level the scores.  There were thirteen minutes left and the Clash had all the momentum on their side as they looked to complete a miraculous turn around.<br>
										<br>
										The opportunity for the Clash to take the lead appeared to have been provided on a plate when Yasayuki was blatantly hacked down in the area, however he immediately sprung back to his feet and the referee played an extremely debatable advantage with defenders and the goalkeeper still between Yasayuki and the goal.  The resulting shot was blocked and the opportunity passed.<br>
										<br>
										The Barbarians now appeared to spring back in to life, creating several half chances in the closing minutes.  Following a fine save from Green low to his right, a series of corners were swung in to the back post, eventually the ball was half cleared outside the area, an attempted shot on goal from the Barbarian's midfield was collected by an inexplicably unmarked forward on the right side of the 6 yard box. The resulting shot was unstoppable.  <br>
										<br>
										The Barbarians celebrated with exuberance and relief.  The Clash's players' heads, for once, dropped.<br>
