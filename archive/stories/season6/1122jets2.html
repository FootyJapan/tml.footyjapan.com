									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 22nd November</b><br>
										Despite a late kick off, waiting for players to arrive Y-Abe started the match in Hanno with only nine players. The Jets looked to press home their numerical advantage early on and did so in the first five minutes.<br>
										 After some good work out on the right Hiro knocked the ball in to Gildart on the edge of the box. Gildart sent Piper through one on one with the keeper and Piper knocked the ball across the six-yard box (in what he controversially labeled an &lsquo;unselfish pass&rsquo; and others labeled a &lsquo;crap shot&rsquo;) for Glen to tuck away his second goal in two games. Y-Abe then found reinforcements and were up to full strength. But the Jets were soon two up. Gould was put through on goal and neatly rounded the keeper, who brought him down on the edge of the area. Jets veteran and free-kick specialist Kobayashi stepped up and knocked the free kick calmly around the wall and into the net. The keeper might have done better but the Jets were 2-0 up and cruising. Unfortunately, cruise control is not always the best way to win a football match.  Y-Abe came back strongly and controlled the ball well in the midfield. Their number 7 was excellent the whole game and started the comeback by rounding several forlorn Jets tackles before sending the ball neatly into the bottom right of the net. Harada in net played a good game but on this occasion had no chance. 2-1. Minutes later it was 2-2. The Jets were thoroughly disappointed to be caught out by a simple straight ball through the middle, the suddenly shaky defense failing to keep up with the speedy Y-Abe right-winger, who calmly slotted it home. <br>
										<br>
										2-2 at the half and some harsh words all round&#x2026; Well, not that harsh, to be honest.  Dez &amp; John captained strongly and brought Dean and Glen (who both look excellent additions to the squad) back on for the second half and things subsequently calmed down a bit. This paid off as the Jets were ahead again within minutes of the restart. A nice ball through from Dean allowed Calvin, the master goal poacher, to knock home a calm finish for 3-2. The defense held firm from then on, with Masato and John looking more relaxed at centre half and any chances Y-Abe might have created were snuffed out with some much-improved tackling.<br>
										<br>
										Then the Jets somehow seemed to find untapped reserves of energy and the game was pretty much finished off by the wing-men. Bentz played well on the left wing, sending in some decent crosses that might well have led to a goal and Setterfield at right-back played excellently to link up with Piper, now on the right. Piper got past the last defender and sent a good ball into the box for Gildart to tuck it home from close range. Another goal came as Piper again pushed the ball past the last defender and fired in a long-range shot, which the keeper parried onto the post, only for Denis to knock it into the unguarded net &#150; a goal the Belarus player claimed was born of anger at an earlier unjust offside decision&#x2026;?  There were other chances, the most impressive a long-range effort from Gildart which came back of the bar. But it finished 5-2 to the Jets.<br>
										<br>
										It was a good game of football all round and I should add that Y-Abe&rsquo;s position in the league is slightly surprising considering the ability they have in their team. Nice bunch of lads too. The referee had a good game, calm and solid throughout and young Jets hopeful, Kylen supported gamely from the sidelines. Most gratifyingly, the beers were all consumed just in time to make a dash for the last train home.<br>
