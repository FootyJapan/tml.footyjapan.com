									<p><b>Hodogaya koen, Saturday 25th October</b><br>
										The Hibs have an unwritten rule that if we score 10 against a team we don&rsquo;t write a match report. Once it reaches that level, the scoreboard really says it all and reflecting on missed chances in the report adding something along the lines of &ldquo;it should have been 15&rdquo;; is not going to go down well. Counting down the final minutes of this match I was hoping we&rsquo;d sneak one more in to leave me some free of writing obligations this weekend. But alas we got stuck in single figures and here I sit bashing away biased dribble at the keyboard during my precious free time again.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As the BEFC had yet to register a point in their four matches this season and the Hibs were on maximum points, we were fighting against complacency going into this one. Luckily the memory of our drawn game in the title run down against the same outfit last season helped to keep us focused &nbsp;Mike McGirr and manager Naoki were both notable absentees, fortunately due to work commitments not injury, but we still lined up with a strong squad of fourteen.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Five minutes in and Eduardo picked up some scraps from a corner, nicked half a yard on his man and rifled a shot in from 18 yards. Another five minutes and Edu had two -tapping in after some good work by Tomo down the right side. Eduardo was looking extra spritely and the Hibs were reaping the benefit of the financial meltdown curtailing the lively Brazilians nocturnal activities. Andre poked one in with his toe &nbsp;Ramario-esque to make it Brazil 3 England 0. As is always the case in these circumstances each goal was definitely a fluke.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The BEFC pulled one back on an under hit back pass; and then Yasu scored one from outside the box to make it 4-1 at half time. Into the second half and we kept a steady pace of a goal every ten minutes, but it felt like everyone was going through the motions. The Embassy would occasionally get their mojo back with a fired up fullback&rsquo;s foray forward or a centre back screaming in a thick northern England accent, but this was generally followed by being forced to chase the ball for twenty passes which repeatedly took the wind out of their sails. Andre got two more to get his hattie and promptly hit the showers. Mission accomplished. The Brazilian Bull is looking extra sharp this season after working hard on his fitness in the off-season and the bookies have been quick to slash his odds of collecting the golden boot down to even money. &nbsp;Edu came back on and completed his hat trick to keep the Samba boys all square and Tomo and Keita got their rewards for creating plenty of goals &nbsp;&#150; Keita bagging one that included a dozen passes and a few flicks &#150; champagne football.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										I would venture to suggest that provided the Hibs avoid injury and loss of players through travel; we&rsquo;ll be looking at the chasing pack becoming increasingly smaller out of the Rear Window, rather being troubled by Vertigo.<br>
