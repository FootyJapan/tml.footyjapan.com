									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 15th February</b><br>
										Zion and the Clash fought out an eventful one-all draw in the early kick-off at Misato on Sunday.<br>
										Perhaps unfortunately, this game will be remembered for more than just the passing football, hard-but-clean competitiveness and a result which probably just about satisfied both teams.  Fortunately, it will definitely be remembered.<br>
										<br>
										The Clash started as if a Red Bull breakfast had been consumed, after just two minutes Daylan Cosco, after being picked out on the edge of the box by his striking partner, Rob Keyworth, saw his volley on the turn narrowly clear the crossbar .<br>
										<br>
										As the first half progressed Zion began to look the more dangerous team, Nixon Da Silva finding space in the Clash box on several occasions, however he was unable to convert his initial chances.  With less than ten minutes to go in the first half, Da Silva finally did get an opportunity that he wasn't going to spurn.  Pete Zollar, playing at left back, mistimed a back pass which was pounced on by the striker, his shot brushing Yasuhiro Makita's gloves on its way in to the roof of the net.<br>
										<br>
										Zion went close to doubling their advantage shortly before half-time when a through ball provided a simple one-on-one with the goalkeeper, however the ever alert Makita dived at the attacker's feet and the shot deflected over for a corner.<br>
										<br>
										The second half started as had the first, with a dangerous Clash attack. The attack culminating in the game's first big controversy.  Jin Shiba's shot from outside of the area struck the bar and rebounded in to the path of Yasuyuki Kataoka following in.  To the players and spectators Kataoka's low header appeared to level the scores.  Unfortunately the flag had gone up for off-side.  And then it went down.  There was confusion everywhere as it appeared Kataoka was on-side when the original shot was struck and this may have accounted for the flag going down.  Somehow the initial decision stood and Zion maintained their lead.<br>
										<br>
										The Zion lead was not to last much longer.  A corner from Sam Reid was half cleared and when the ball was played back in by Masa Hanamura it found its way across a crowded box to Tony Moore at the back post. Turning on his favoured left foot, Moore buried the ball in to the back of the net with his right.  Unfortunately the flag had gone up for off-side again.  And this time it stayed up.  Although this time the referee realised that the flag was nonsense and the goal stood.<br>
										<br>
										With the midfield battle being won, it was now the Clash's turn to dominate proceedings with wave after wave of attacks in search of the elusive winner.  The best chance came from a powerful out swinging cross delivered from the left by Kataoka which, with the keeper well out of position, was headed agonisingly wide by Cosco.<br>
										<br>
										Zion were largely limited to counter-attacking during the second half. Although the Clash defence remained resolutely organised and alert to the end, the pace of Da Silva meant the game was never safe.  With less than ten minutes to go Zion had two notable attacks, the first culminating in top class save from Makita, bravely blocking a near point-blank shot at the near post.  The second involved even more desperate measures with the ball being cleared of the line by the covering Clash centre back to deny Zion a winning goal.<br>
										<br>
										With less than five minutes left to play, a series of events would ensure that this game will not be remembered as just a well competed draw.  A loose ball dropped on the left side of the centre circle, Moore believed he had won the ball for the Clash before being clattered with a late, studs-up challenge.  The whistle was blown, however the decision went in favour of Zion.  The clearly aghast and agitated Clash left-winger indicated that he would like the referee to explain his decision.  Following the referee's explanation Moore turned to take up a defensive position, regrettably the conclusions that he voiced based on the referee's explanation led to the referee brandishing a straight red card.<br>
										<br>
										The game played out an uneventful last few minutes as Zion failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage.<br>
										<br>
										The post-match discussions had two main themes.  The first involved what was said, to whom it was said, when it was said and why it was said. The second involved the rules of football.  Both themes of discussion distracted from what had been a cracking game..<br>
