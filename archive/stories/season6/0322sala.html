									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 22nd March<br>
										</b><br>
										Sala vs Swiss, an original TML/IFFL fixture that is best described, perhaps, against a backdrop of relevant statistics from campaigns past and present.  And a few irrelevant ones as well.<br>
										<br>
										To the numbers then.  The Swiss turned up on a windy Sunday evening with the bare 11.  Sala, on the other hand, had a full 16 once again and welcomed back Toby, Yusuke, Take, and Koji, but they were also without several of their own regulars &#150; Brookey was back in Norwich, doing what it is that people do in Norwich, while Scotty and Sam followed Andy Cross&rsquo; lead in the Tokyo Marathon.  Now, while Andy is a seasoned veteran on this front, rumour had it that Scott&rsquo;s pre-race training consisted of one 25-km run, along the Edogawa, in 2005; and Sam apparently went straight to the starting line from a CD-launch party in Shinjuku the night before.<br>
										<br>
										8:  Total number of marathons, including Tokyo, that Andy has now run before heading to the U.S. next month for some obscure little race in Boston.<br>
										50%:  Chance that Sam tried to chat up one of the young, female celebrity runners &#x2026; in the post-race tent area.<br>
										108%:  Chance that Scotty did so &#x2026; during the first 20 km &#x2026; and again in the post-race tent area.<br>
										<br>
										In any event, well done to all three finishers.  But back to Fukuda Denshi. <br>
										<br>
										14:  Approximate number of Sala-Swiss matches since 2000.<br>
										8:  Estimated number of draws in Sala-Swiss matches since 2000.<br>
										0-0:  Result of October&rsquo;s Sala-Swiss match.<br>
										<br>
										Nevertheless, Sala were feeling good about this one after a recent run of wins and some decent form, but the gusting wind prevented both teams from maintaining possession and putting together any useful combination play in the opening frame.  There was little to choose between the two sides at this early stage, so with the score still level, Sala did what they&rsquo;ve so often done under similar circumstances in the past; they gave the ball to Shige.<br>
										<br>
										21:  Percentage of what Shigeru has probably understood in about five years&rsquo; worth of team talks &#150; including gestures and facial expressions &#150; until Yusuke&rsquo;s recent practice of taking on all match-related translations for the Sala midfielder.  And on cue, it was Shige who opened up the match and the scoring around the 10-minute mark with a 20-yarder into the bottom left corner.  This brought some flow and purpose back into Sala&rsquo;s play, and soon thereafter young Rob, the club&rsquo;s winter transfer signing from Norwich (University, Vermont), beat a couple of Swiss defenders at the top of the box before sliding it over to an overlapping Ryotaro to make it 2-0.<br>
										<br>
										As players began to connect, Rob and Stu proved a tireless striking pair and showed well for the ball, but on several occasions they were forced into 40-metre sprints as Sid&rsquo;s wind-assisted kicks nearly bounced over the Swiss goal at the other end of the park.  However, Pete was getting a lot of the ball at this point and hitting precision passes to his target men, with good support play from Clarkey, Ian, Dave, Dan, and Yusuke.  The latter were equally adept at snuffing out any Swiss advances into the Sala zone, both on the deck and in the air, while Lenny was now putting in his usual mixture of deceptive speed and weighted crosses (not to mention some solid defensive tracking) on the left.  <br>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										35, give or take:  Average distance, in yards, of Clarkey&rsquo;s headers on the night.<br>
										2025, give or take:  The year when Lenny and baby Sean will likely take to the pitch as Sala&rsquo;s first father-and-son set of wing halves.  But Lenny will still have him for pace.<br>
										<br>
										Sala&rsquo;s third, which can only be described as a flying Ralph Macchio-esque side-foot gym-kata volley that completely flummoxed the Swiss keeper, occurred when Dave found himself in an advanced position and met another of Lenny&rsquo;s incoming balls.  Tough call; there may have been some substance to Swiss complaints of high foot (or feet, and knees, hips, arse), but the goal stood and brought Dave&rsquo;s tally to three in the past two games.  Moving on:<br>
										<br>
										12:  Toby&rsquo;s goal tally so far this season.<br>
										11:  The number of those goals that I can recall.  Sorry.  So let&rsquo;s approach this logically.  Roughly half of Toby&rsquo;s markers are scored via headers following salmon-like leaps and a hang time of six seconds.  Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, there were no headed goals in this match, so it&rsquo;s quite clear then:  Sala&rsquo;s fourth came after Toby Long turned a Swiss defender one way, turned him the other way, then unleashed a left-footer into the far corner.<br>
										<br>
										4-0 at half time, and it&rsquo;s completely possible that other than the opener, the order of goals as described above is incorrect.  That said, on to the second half.<br>
										<br>
										The wind continued to wreak havoc on passing accuracy, but the weather gods made up for it by adding a little drizzle as well.  Pete was done for the day, and as it had been in the opening 10 minutes, Sala were once again finding it difficult to create any meaningful opportunities in the early going.  Gradually, though, Take&rsquo;s and Koji&rsquo;s alternating stints on the right began to leave their mark on the match. Koji in particular had one of his better games, combining his attacking runs with an equal balance of defensive toughness and tenacity that complemented Dan&rsquo;s solid work behind him.  Ryotaro, too, was a constant handful as he jinked his way up the left, but let&rsquo;s not forget about the Swiss.<br>
										<br>
										3:  Number of Sala players involved in the comedy of errors that led to the Swiss goal.  To be fair, it wasn&rsquo;t unreasonable for them to get onto the score sheet as they did have some spells of good ball movement.  It&rsquo;s just that this wasn&rsquo;t one of them.  Picture a relatively harmless-looking ball dropping slowly toward the top/side of the Sala penalty area.<br>
										<br>
										Clarkey:  &ldquo;Clarkey&rsquo;s ball!&rdquo; (with Motherwell/Glaswegian accent)<br>
										Yusuke:  &ldquo;Hai, Yusuke&rsquo;s ball!&rdquo; (in local Funabashian tone)<br>
										Clarkey:  &ldquo;Clarkey&rsquo;s!!&rdquo;<br>
										Yusuke:  &ldquo;Yusuke&rsquo;s!!&rdquo;<br>
										<br>
										You get the idea.  Admirable commitment and dogged determination on both their parts, the result of which was a scuffed ball that spun up and back/sideways to the waiting Swiss #11.  The striker&rsquo;s contribution to this football theatre was then to lose his footing and hit a weak shot just slightly to the left of Sid, who returned the favour by falling onto his arthritic hip/not-yet-healed back and parrying the ball with his still-hurting wrist back into the striker&rsquo;s path.  Goal for Swiss, 4-1 Sala.<br>
										<br>
										The next was reminiscent of a dubious strike, at Oi Dirt several seasons back, by Sala alumnus/turncoat/returnee Brian Gallagher.<br>
										<br>
										<br>
										12, plus/minus 3:  Random guess on the number of players in TML history whose crosses have inadvertently found their way into the top corner.<br>
										3, plus/minus 3:  Number of players who&rsquo;ve admitted that said balls were crosses.<br>
										<br>
										On that previous occasion, Brian had unabashedly and unapologetically claimed a shot.  On this day, however, Take politely refrained from commenting at all, but let&rsquo;s just say that he usually puts in a quality delivery from the right flank and that up until then, had never tried shooting while six yards from the corner flag.  Windy indeed.  5-1 Sala.<br>
										<br>
										The last goal was Shigeru&rsquo;s second, a near-copy of his first.  In between Take&rsquo;s and Shige&rsquo;s strikes, any or all of Rob, Stu, Toby, Ryotaro, Koji, Lenny (and possibly even Sid and the entire back line) tried their luck with numerous shots from distance that were either stopped by the Swiss keeper or missed the target by anything from a few inches to a dozen yards.  The wind.  Ian, who had now moved into midfield, could also have gotten onto the score sheet but the ball simply wouldn&rsquo;t sit for him.  Damn wind.  As before, the Swiss had their moments as well, but the final ball was often just a little beyond reach.  Credit to them, though, for leaving any frustration and nastiness out of the tackles, and to Quentin for his usual fairness with the whistle.<br>
										<br>
										So, 6-1 is how it ended and Sala hope to carry this momentum into their next match with BEFC.  For the Swiss, here&rsquo;s hoping that they return to winning ways soon &#x2026; now that we&rsquo;ve completed both fixtures.  In closing, some final statistics:<br>
										<br>
										12:  Number of active Sala players who live in Tokyo, Yokohama, or Saitama.  This has nothing whatsoever to do with the match, but is meant as an aside for all teams that must travel to Soga.  A very nice ground and quite worth the trip, and just as far for many members of this so-called Chiba side.<br>
										<br>
										5:  Number of Sala-affiliated players mentioned in this report who were nowhere near Fukuda Denshi on Sunday evening.  And lastly:<br>
										<br>
										2:  Number of times that Norwich (England, as opposed to Norwich University, Vermont) has been mentioned in this report; surely a record, even in Norwich (England).<br>
										4:  Necessary revision to the stat above, after acknowledging the stat above.<br>
