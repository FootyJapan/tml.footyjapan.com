									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 26th October</b><br>
										Celts rocked up to their 4th game of the season having had a mix bag of results in the previous 3 games, beating Geckoes 2-1 then a 1-1 draw with BFC before succumbing to a 0-3 defeat to YCAC. One could be forgiven for the optimism of a result against the new newly promoted France FC and with that Celts took the field with an air of confidence despite the absence of some key regulars (Peter, Dermot, Jo, Yuki &amp; Wayne).<br>
										Celts kicked off and surrendered possession cheaply letting France FC an early foray into the Celts area which was calmly handled by the Celts defense. Celts then launched an all out assault into the French territory which resulted in a succession of corners. Oli stepped up to drive the corner into the middle of the French box where Toru rose above the mass of players to direct his header into the back of the next 1-0 to Celts with 8 minutes of the game gone.<br>
										<br>
										In spite of the Celts possession France FC managed to pull a goal back after 24 minutes when some shabby defending on the left let a cross from the left wing to find it way into the Celts box for the France FC striker to make it 1-1. The French equalizer seemed to rejuvenate the France FC team and they were starting to get a foot hold in the middle of the park, however Celts continued to dominate possession and had the opportunity to go ahead when Gav had a header from Toru&rsquo;s corner, on the edge of the 6 yard box, only to see his downward header, bounce and go over the cross bar. With 30 minutes gone Oli and Vince played a quick one-two to open up the French defense and Vince rifled in a shot from the edge of the box that went in off the underside of the cross bar to make it 2-1 Celts. The remainder of the first half saw opportunities for Celts to further their lead with Oli, Vince and Jonesy all coming close, however the half ended 2-1 to the Celts.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										6 minutes into the 2nd half Celts scored a third goal from good interplay on the wing from Will &amp; Vince and a cross into the box to Oli who hit &nbsp;low hard drive into the bottom left hand corner making it 3-1.&nbsp; France FC then stepped up a gear and after 11 minutes pulled one back to make it 3-2.&nbsp; The game continued at high tempo with both teams having chances, with 15 minutes to play the French found their top gear and &nbsp;pushed for a equalizer, dominating the middle of the Park and making numerous opportunities that were all well dealt with by the Celts back four. Celts had the opportunities on the break to put to game away but poor finishing let them down.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Over all Celts were the better team that made more chances, but failed to covert the opportunities otherwise there could have been a few more goals. Overall a good fair game well played by both teams and well refereed by Paul.<br>
