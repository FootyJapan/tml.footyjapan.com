						Oh no, here we go again.

						Picture this, gentle reader. It`s 9PM, the freezing rain stings more than Jorge Kuriyama`s secret <i>Jalape&ntilde;o</i> sauce and you are abt 100 km from home. Your team is up 3-2 against the squad at the top of the league with five minutes to go. One of your strikers just hit the post. What do you do? Of course you concede two goals just in time for the (excellent) ref to blow the whistle. Sure, the strong FC International team play great football and dominated the game, but the Dutch held their own, evening the score twice before taking the lead, thanks to teamwork and their swift strikers. Such is the cruel game of football. On to the next game...<br>

					<p><b>Daito Bunka, Sunday 16th November</b><br>
						Even when he is sent off Carlos Aranda makes an impact. TML Champions BFC went from 2-1 and not overly impressive to 5-1 after 'El Mulleto' (you were warned, Carlos) got his marching orders for an ill-advised shove on a Geckoes player. The same score as last year's meeting on the same Mickey Mouse pitch between the two sides and a result, which like season, saw champions BFC climb above Geckoes in TML1 ... so, you know, that's good. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/1116bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 9th November</b><br>
						The Hibs and France have a colourful history dating back to a time when the TML was not even a twinkle in Sid's eye. So it was good to finally reacquaint ourselves after&nbsp;France's one year hiatus in division two. France FC are a feisty bunch and a game against them is always likely to have its share of thrills, spills and controversy. This one was no different. We&rsquo;ve had some memorable games over the years including the last kick of the game goal that saw us win&nbsp;3-2 Hibs after being down 2-0 down at half time and the 8-5 victory after going down 1-0 to 10 men after two minutes before bouncing back to be 7-1 up at half time. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/1109hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Monday 3rd November</b><br>
						BFC&rsquo;s season seems to have hit a snag after they were caught out by some very physical and hungry Lions. BFC have also made it a habit of not writing match reports when they lose. But this time, instead of claiming amnesia or lack of visual acuity, BFC will humbly eat pie this week and accept the &ldquo;shame.&rdquo; We were well and truly beaten.<br>
						<br>
						The match had many talking points and bizarre events and I will skirt around many of them as decorum requires. Guess who the referee was. There was even blood as the mighty Norse god Garry needed stitches from a collision of heads early in the first half. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/1103bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Oi Futo, Saturday 1st November</b><br>
						As most TML players will know, there are occasions when it is necessary to play together with complete strangers in order to get 11 men out on the field. And, as is natural, it is almost impossible to strike up an immediate understanding with someone you have just met. It was this problem, more than anything that led to Y-Abe FC's 5-1 tonking at the hands of El Diego. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/1101yabe.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The Celts and Hibs have had a local-derby type rivalry akin to a Man City v Man U and have always had close games which have been played in (largely) good spirit. Both teams come from Irish roots, but in recent years the Celts have had more Irish players than the Hibs. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/1101hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
