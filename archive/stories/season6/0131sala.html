									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 31st January</b><br>
										If only Sala could face FJ Plate opposition every week, and play on nice dry pitches,&nbsp;their current transitional phase would be a lot easier to&nbsp;come through.&nbsp; However, with a waterlogged pitch and a hungry Celts team eager to cement their place in the TML above Sala, there was to be no easy ride in this match.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Indeed, it was strength and hunger, in these cold&nbsp;wet conditions, that were the key factors in the Celts'&nbsp;victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sala looked good in the first 20 minutes, with Toby and Sam proving a handful up front, but with the Celts' penalty area heavily waterlogged most of Sala's moves came to a halt in the puddles, or were charged down by the Celt's keeper.&nbsp; The wet conditions gave the Celts' defence the extra yard they needed to catch up with Sala's pacy forwards, and as a result Sala's trickery and skill just wasn't enough to give them the lead they deserved.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As the game went on,&nbsp;the more physical and direct approach of the Celts started to look menacing.&nbsp; And, it seemed Celts would&nbsp;produce the first goal&nbsp;after Clarkey brought down their number 9&nbsp;for a penalty.&nbsp; Sala's shouts that&nbsp;the tackle&nbsp;was outside the box looked to have been overlooked until the referee wisely consulted his linesman and changed his decision to a freekick on the adge of the area.&nbsp; Major controversy afoot!&nbsp; And the ref wasn't finished there.&nbsp; The freekick came to nothing, but then, amazingly, minutes later the same thing happened at the other end.&nbsp; Toby was sent through, rounded the keeper, and was clattered to the ground.&nbsp; The ref pointed to the spot again.&nbsp; Celts appealed and pointed to the linesman, and again the referee consulted him.&nbsp; This time though the linesman said the foul was in the box.&nbsp; Toby stepped up and&nbsp;blasted home his second spot kick in a week.&nbsp; &nbsp;1-0 Sala.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Unfortunately, for Sala, it was at this point that Celts' power and desire became to much for them to handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Celts&nbsp;began to bully midfield,&nbsp;Henry and Toru dominating,&nbsp;and their long balls and direct running began to stretch Sala's defence.&nbsp; A defensive mistake at the back&nbsp;whilst defending a free kick gifted them&nbsp;their equaliser.&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, it was 1-1 at&nbsp;halftime.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half started with a horrific blunder from Sala's keeper.&nbsp; Another Celt's free kick went straight through his legs and into the net.&nbsp; From here on it was all Celts, save for a consolation tap in for Ryoutaro at the end, and several long rangers from Shige.&nbsp; Celt's 3rd came from another keeper error, before their 4th was tapped in by Toru, after a long shot had bounced back off the bar.&nbsp; 4-2 Celts.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										All in all, Sala are definetely a work in progress.&nbsp;Thankfully, they seem to&nbsp;have put an end to their internal bickering on the pitch but at the same time they've lost a bit of fight against the opposition.&nbsp; Finding the right balance will, in the future, take them back to&nbsp;the top of the table, but until then, sports fans, bear with us!!<br>
