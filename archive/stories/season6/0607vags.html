									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday, June 7th</b><br>
										Vags ended a rather mediocre season in terms of league position and results but a good one regarding the consolidation and development of the team&rsquo;s core. A small squad turned out for the final game of the season at 7:30 on a Sunday night, just when the over 40&rsquo;s amongst us are thinking about horlicks and a bath. On the other hand the conditions were great and it turned out to be a good contest.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Clash needed to win to avoid relegation and given this, the pre match talk was all about matching them for up-for-it-ness. The game started fairly well-balanced with the midfields making things very tight and compact and there were few chances of note. Clash looked dangerous from set pieces though and from a well flighted free kick managed to take advantage of the fact that the Vags defenders were marking the penalty spot. The effort was bundled home off the belly of the centre half (Graham is key eye witness here) and that was that. This gave them added impetus and they definitely shaded the rest of the half.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Despite this though, the Vagabonds started the second half well and continued to push without getting too frustrated. Lyndsey was even more industrious than usual (14 hours to sleep off the hangover rather than 6). Amos got more and more into the game as the second half wore on and James B&rsquo;s pace caused the usual problems, just the final touch/pass letting him down once or twice. Pushing led to a couple of scary moments at the back but Ged and Steve were able to get a foot in at the right time. Long shots didn&rsquo;t trouble Graham at all.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As we entered the final 10 minutes, there was more and more urgency, especially down the right, James flashed in two good crosses, Richard had a half chance of a header from another Lyndsey Delap throw, Sean was involved in some pinball moments in the box and then, finally, Wayne stepped up to fire in his first of the season with a curling effort from the edge of the area which the Clash keeper just couldn&rsquo;t get high enough to keep out.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										I think 1-1 was a pretty fair reflection of the game but spare a thought for the Clash who are really victims of being the odd one out at the tail end of this incredibly tight season. They gave it their all and are more than capable of bouncing straight back. Nice bunch of guys too. For the Vags &#150; moments of reflection follow (and I mean moments &#150; because the bar is just over there&#x2026;) before we enjoy the summer and come back fitter (only kidding!) and stronger next season.<br>
