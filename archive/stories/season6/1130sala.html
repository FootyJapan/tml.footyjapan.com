									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 30th November</b><br>
										<br>
										26/11/08&nbsp; 04:30 Hours - Commandos arrive in Methven and&nbsp;airlift strike legend to Japan!<br>
										26/11/08&nbsp;&nbsp;10:05 Hours - Gravediggers arrive in Kichijoji and exhume trusty goalkeeper!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										It was these two events that led to the&nbsp;legendary pair, Giles Legg (one of Sala FC's founding fathers) and Andy Cross (stalwart goalkeeper of many a past and present TML team)&nbsp;turning out for Sala against the Lions.&nbsp; Good on them both!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game got off to a flyer with both teams attacking purposefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear&nbsp;straight away though that the Lions were playing a shaky offside trap, and that Toby&nbsp;had the pace to&nbsp;beat their defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;With Sala's midfield getting into their stride quickly, and the Sala defence looking comfortable,&nbsp;the writing was on the wall for the Lions.&nbsp; Crisp slick passing through midfield mixed with some probing long balls from the back gave&nbsp;the strikers&nbsp;the service they needed.&nbsp; And sure enough, Toby banged in a quickfire hatrick&nbsp;near the start of the first half.&nbsp; All 3 goals coming in a 15 minute spell.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first came from Take's long ball.&nbsp; The Lions defence was caught napping, with Toby sprinting onto the pass and slotting calmly past the keeper.&nbsp; Take said after the match&nbsp;&quot;I wanted to kick a long pass to Toby&quot; and that's exactly what he did.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second&nbsp;was crafted in the midfield&nbsp;with Scotty feeding Lenny on the left, and&nbsp;the ever able winger picking out toby with a great (hopefully intentional) near post cross, which Toby met first time with a low left foot shot into the corner.&nbsp; Class finishing again from Sala's top marksman.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Toby's hatrick&nbsp;was completed minutes later after another long ball from Ian sent&nbsp;him through again.&nbsp; Showing strength and awareness, he held off&nbsp;a last gasp challenge from a defender and&nbsp;drilled a low shot&nbsp;into the Lion's goal.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sala's fourth came after some nice build up play.&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting the ball from the defence, Shige played a simple square ball to Scotty, who drove&nbsp;forward, then slipped a nice through ball to Toby.&nbsp;&nbsp;He darted into the box again but was pushed wide by the defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to&nbsp;Koji's good&nbsp;support&nbsp;play though Toby was able to pick his strike partner out with a square ball across the box.&nbsp; Koji took it round the keeper with his first touch&nbsp;and slotted home from an angle that was tighter than Brookey's&nbsp;grasp on his wallet.&nbsp; A calm finish under pressure. 4-0 Sala.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game was far from over though, and credit must be given to the Lions, who didn't give up and kept attacking the whole game.&nbsp; The Lions&nbsp;played a lot of nice football with flair and skill, and their tackling was fair, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, they pulled a goal back either side of&nbsp;halftime to set up a nervous finish to the game.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half was a bit slack from Sala but after such a blistering start,&nbsp;that was understandable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenny struck the post&nbsp;(actually it was the padding around the post that we forgot to take off after the kiddie's footy match before us.&nbsp; Damn those little mites!) with a ripper of a freekick, Stu came close with a shot&nbsp;from inside the box, Scotty amazingly got his first booking&nbsp;(overdue&nbsp;more than Brookey getting a round in), Andy Cross&nbsp;used his undead powers to make a few stops, &nbsp;and the Bear rushed out of his cave,&nbsp;marauded&nbsp;up to opponents 18 yard box to set up a 5 vs 1 attack,&nbsp;THEN had a rush of blood to his furry head and&nbsp;hit the worst through ball of&nbsp;all time to no one.&nbsp; &quot;Back to your cave, bad Bear!&quot; we all cried in unison.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Great stuff all round and back to winning ways for Sala.&nbsp; Lastly, a wee mention for Sam and Take who caused so many problems going forward, especially in the first half.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Man of the Match&nbsp;-&nbsp;Toby Long.&nbsp; 3 goals and 1 assist. A tremendous performance.<br>
