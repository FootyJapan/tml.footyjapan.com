									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 21st December</b><br>
										On a balmy December night in Saitama the Clash earned a long overdue first victory of the season by defeating the Dutch 2-1 in a hard fought encounter.  Following a missed penalty from the Dutch, Andy Gill opened the scoring for the Clash with a stunning goal midway through the first half.  It was 2-0 at the break after Rob Keyworth coolly put away a back-post header.<br>
										<br>
										The early exchanges in the first half saw honours even between the teams.  Gill, starting on the left of midfield, going closest for the Clash when he pounced on a bouncing ball in the six yard box, his shot beat the Dutch keeper before clipping the top of the bar.  <br>
										<br>
										The Dutch enjoyed few chances early on, Simon Sanders in the Clash goal was rarely tested.  However with the run of the game turning towards the Clash, a loose ball in the Clash area was collected by the Dutch attack. Ian Webster may have thought that he had won the ball with his aggressive challenge, however he certainly collected the man as well and there were few complaints when the referee pointed to the spot.  The Dutch failed to convert, the ball rebounding off the inside of the right-hand post before being safely knocked out of play by an alert defence.<br>
										<br>
										A moment of sheer quality then changed the game.  Collecting a perfectly weighted through ball from Keyworth, Gill held off his marker as he surged in to the area before cutting back with his left and burying the ball in to the top corner with his right.  The Dutch keeper never stood a chance of getting a hand on it.  <br>
										<br>
										The Clash, attacking with renewed vigour, doubled their lead shortly before half time.  A text book corner from Jin dipped and curled towards the back post where Keyworth, playing as a lone striker, made room in the crowd of players before making no mistake with a pin-point header to put the ball in to the back of net.<br>
										<br>
										The Dutch may have considered themselves unlucky to go in to the break two goals down, the Clash advantage was only preserved due to a goal line headed clearance from Yu Shirai on the stroke of half time.  <br>
										<br>
										A lower key second half saw the Clash attempt to control the game by slowing things down and keeping their organisation at the back.  However a soft, albeit very well taken, goal for the Dutch ensured that the game would remain a contest to the end.  <br>
										<br>
										A short goal kick to Daylon Cosco put the right back immediately under pressure and he was swiftly dispossessed by the ensuing Dutch left wing. Despite a valiant effort to cut off the charge towards the Clash goal there was nothing that could be done when a powerful shot was unleashed, brushing the keeper's gloves on the way in to the top of the net. Both teams continued to find it hard to carve out clear cut chances, Kazz Ishizaki going closest for the Clash with a shot on to the bar from just inside the area.  <br>
										<br>
										With less than half an hour to go the Clash reintroduced Doug Lee to play in front of the back four to stiffen up the defence.  This worked well, stifling any midfield creativity from the Dutch whilst forcing them to defend more deeply as Gill, now playing in a more advanced position, and Paul James both continued to stretch the Dutch defence in their search for a third goal to kill-off the game.<br>
										<br>
										The Clash defence kept its shape and discipline in the closing stages to snuff out the attacks of the Dutch.  As the final whistle went, the Clash celebrated  a fine victory over a very good Dutch team, it was their first league win since March.   With a performance like this it is unlikely that there will be a need to wait quite as long for the next victory.<br>
