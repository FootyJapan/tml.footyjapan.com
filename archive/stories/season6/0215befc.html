									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 15th February</b><br>
										Nine hundred and ninety minutes into the season and the monkey has been well and truly yanked from our backs. That's right! The Embassy have a point! Watch out Hibs &#150; our title charge is back on!!<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a dogged encounter under floodlit Hachioji, old foes - the Embassy and the French - battled to a 2-2 draw, and in doing so `les blancs'<br>
										became the first team to suffer the indignity of conceding a point to the Embassy boys. In truth, it could have been even better for the Embassy who led late into the game, but overall a draw was probably just about right.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Embassy started well, knocking the ball around assuredly and creating a few half chances. Then, midway through the half Takanori and Hal linked up to find Alex whose composed play laid on a sitter for Osamu to tap home. Sadly, that was to be one of Osamu's last acts of the game as he limped off with a badly swollen ankle, the result of an over-zealous tackle, of which there were many during the game. The Embassy looked fairly comfortable at half time with Ferdy combative and Taka Y and Gary marshalling the defense well. 1-0, but you just knew that wasn't the end of it!<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the Embassy couldn't get their previously crisp passing back, and little by little the French began to push forward and cause a few problems. From one such surge, a shot from the edge of the area wasn't dealt with by Keith and the forward followed up to stab home.<br>
										That was harsh on Keith who was later to make a brilliant save from a Jorge free kick, and come out to block several other chances.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost immediately though, the Embassy were a whisker away from regaining the lead. Takanori, as sweet a striker of the ball as you will see in TML, hit one from about thirty yards, rattling the post before bouncing away off the stunned keeper's head. He wasn't to be denied though, as ten minutes from time, he spotted the keeper slightly out of position, and curled one left footed into the corner.<br>
										The Embassy celebrated as they sensed that this was going to be their day.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't. A bloody corner our undoing for the 284th time this season. Good cross, decent header, Embassy sink to their knees &#150; 2-2.<br>
										Oh well, a point is better than a kick in the teeth and hopefully it will be the one that kick-starts the season.<br>
