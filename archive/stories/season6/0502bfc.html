									<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 3rd May</b><br>
										
										Be nice if the TML posted this report. It is an accurate reflection of events which spoiled a perfect evening under a crescent-shaped moon.<br>
										<br>
										Result: BFC held to a 1-1 draw by the Lions. A flag-happy linesman and a referee who should have over-ruled a blatantly false offside left a sour taste.<br>
										<br>
										<b>NOTHING RIDING ON THIS GAME YET ...</b><br>
										<br>
										The Lions can call it sour grapes, as no doubt they will, but with nothing on the line after YCAC deservedly wrapped up the TML title, it was sad that a game played on a perfect pitch (that BFC go to great lengths to procure) on a perfect evening should descend into such farce.<br>
										<br>
										This was a return to the dark ages of the 'league that shall not be named' we used to be involved in before the TML gallantly rescued amateur football for serious players in Tokyo and beyond.<br>
										<br>
										Minutes from the TML's annual AGM noted that the league would be in trouble if linesmen provided by teams did not do the job with integrity and honesty. Well ... in all seriousness, this was a joke.<br>
										<br>
										No amount of beer, no okonomiyaki, not even a comfortable 3-0 win over Newcastle could make up for it.<br>
										<br>
										BFC should have been a goal up, after Himmer swept home a clever reverse pass from teenager Hamish on 20 minutes, but for a ridiculous flag. Hamish was two yards onside and his pass was played backwards! What planet the linesman lives on is unclear but the referee's refusal to over-rule the decision as utter twaddle was equally bizarre.<br>
										<br>
										<b>HE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED</b><br>
										<br>
										Yes, even HE would have had the sense to over-rule it. It was that clear. There have been several games this season -- I can think of excellent refs, such as the Scouser and the Q-Man who have, in similar circumstances, simply pointed to the centre circle and a restart. Not the case here 'tho.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										Five minutes later the Lions were a goal ahead. No complaints about their goal, other than the hopeless BFC defending, but the sense of injustice was galling.<br>
										<br>
										Within moments, the Lions trigger-mad 'assistant' was at it again, when Aranda's shot fizzed in and Evans pounced on the rebound to smash home from 30 centimetres. Up shot the flag, as if on auto-pilot. This time the referee had to give the goal -- and quite rightly relieved the lino of his duties.<br>
										<br>
										Aranda's shot had come in from 25 metres and Evans had at least two defenders between him and the keeper before he reacted quickest to the loose ball.<br>
										<br>
										Exasperated BFC players suggested to the ref we do away with linesmen, while Lions keeper Orlando tried to end the halftime bickering by kindly offering to run the line. The damage had been done.<br>
										<br>
										A similar dodgy flag triggered acrimony in the previous meeting between the sides, which the record books show was won by the Lions 1-0 after Day had scored following&nbsp; a reverse pass played from the goal line - yes, how can that be offside?<br>
										<br>
										<b>GRISLY SECOND HALF</b><br>
										<br>
										The second half was grisly. Hamish clattered blind-side and the referee refusing to stop play until BFC players had pointed out, with a few choice words, that the 16-year-old was in real pain. He would leave the ground his back iced up and shuffling like Dr. Lowes. Day would also limp home and then to hospital, his season possibly hacked short in the first half, from a despicable challenge in the first half, late &amp; from behind, studs up, leaving the ex-skipper on the floor writhing in agony.<br>
										<br>
										Second half synopsis: Hamish hit the post, Evans skied, Day was brilliantly denied by Orlando, Himmer tried to pick out Aranda when a shot was the clearly better option and Lions could have caught BFC on the break a couple of times.<br>
										<br>
										That, basically, summed up a second half that was, unfortunately, never about the football as the game was allowed to run ragged.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										Lions can argue all they like but it was impossible to keep count of all the reckless, and frankly dangerous, tackles from behind and players being offered little protection from the official who may be better suited to the lower divisions.<br>
										<br>
										The ankles and Achilles tendons of several BFC players looked like minced meat after the game, the BFC forwards in particular routinely hacked with their backs to goal.<br>
										<br>
										On this point, the 'profuse apology' and hand offered in help after the umpteenth time you have gone through the back of someone means ZILCH. How about you just stop doing it?<br>
										<br>
										No blame is attached to the TML, who are desperate for quality refs. If you know one, do give them a call. Remember a weekend can be ruined by this sort of cobblers so give it some thought. An expanding league means more demand, so think on, folks.<br>
										<br>
										Congrats to YCAC. They were awesome this season, BFC were never at the races. Hibs will have all sort of 'ownership' issues. After three years without winning the division one title, how they managed to claim possession of it, calling it 'their title' is a bit of a mystery. There's always next year. For all of us.<br>
