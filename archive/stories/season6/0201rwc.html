									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 1st February</b><br>
										At YCAC the Clash came back from two-nil down at halftime to beat Jetro 3-2.<br>
										<br>
										This game was perhaps less team versus team over two halves, than each team taking a turn to play the weather for a half.  With an incredibly strong and cold wind blowing lengthways down the pitch from the club house end of the ground, the team with their backs to the wind were always going to find the going considerably easier.  <br>
										<br>
										And so it proved, all five goals were scored at the same end.<br>
										<br>
										Jetro easily enjoyed the territorial advantage in the first half, however up until the opening goal after twenty minutes, they had struggled to create any meaningful chances.  Indeed, during the Clash's sporadic sorties in to the oppositions half, the team in yellow looked the more likely to score.<br>
										<br>
										However, when Jetro got the better of a midfield battle, a well hit shot from a long way outside the area caught the wind and flew in to the top left hand corner of the net.  No fault could be attributed to the Clash defence or to Yasuhiro Makita in goal, kudos to the Jetro midfielder for<br>
										playing to the conditions.<br>
										<br>
										The second goal owed even more to the weather.  A Jetro corner cleared the first defender, the keeper stretched to punch the ball clear, unfortunately a punch that would normally have seen the ball leave the penalty area just made it hang in the air, when it dropped Jetro were first to it in the chaotic box, jabbing the ball past the fallen keeper.<br>
										<br>
										Jetro could have made it three shortly before half time, a poor clearance was gathered by the Jetro attack, however the goalkeeper flung himself bravely at the feet of the striker to snuff out the danger. Despite the 2-0 score line at halftime, the players on both teams knew that this match was far from over.<br>
										<br>
										Within five minutes of the restart the deficit was reduced to one goal. The Clash strikers were linking well with the midfield and each other when a through ball from Daylan Cosco was collected by Raph Colella on the edge of the box.  After taking a touch Colella strolled calmly towards the goal before hammering the ball past the helpless keeper's left hand.<br>
										<br>
										With Jetro facing the same issues with the wind that the Clash had endured during the first half, a second Clash goal looked inevitable. A series of debatable offside decisions saw a number of attacks end prematurely but the Clash were not to be denied.  It was that man Colella again who found himself in plenty of space on the right hand side of the box, his low, hard shot across the keeper going in off the post.<br>
										<br>
										At two each and with 20 minutes to go, the Clash were now strong favourites to get the victory.  When the winning goal came it owed about as much to the weather as Jetro's second had done.<br>
										<br>
										From midway inside the Jetro half, Jin Shiba struck a free kick in the direction of the advancing attackers.  Again the wind deviated the course of the ball, the Jetro keeper, like Makita in the first half, came to punch the ball clear.  Quite amazingly, despite solid contact with the goal keeper's gloves, the ball maintained it's course towards the now unguarded net.  The ensuing Clash players were not required to help the ball on its way for what would be the decisive goal.<br>
										<br>
										In the closing stages the Clash defence had to deal with an enlivened Jetro attack, however discipline at the back was maintained to ensure victory.  <br>
										<br>
										Although the weather added an extra dimension to the game, ultimately it was team versus team and the better team won.<br>
