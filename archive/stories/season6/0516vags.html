									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday, May 16th</b><br>
										Vags extended their winning streak to 4 with a good one against Maritzio. Maritzio&rsquo;s results have improved considerably of late and it was a much changed (and improved) squad that lined up against us, and the game was in sharp contrast to the two comfortable victories already posted against them this season. <br>
										<br>
										Vags themselves were short of numbers and bolstered the squad with a couple of youngsters - Brian and Phil &#150; combined age 80....(have your own guess as to how it splits). Ringers indeed.........what nonsense.<br>
										<br>
										Richard decided to start with the always controversial 3-5-2 and was met with the barrage of opposition that is Ged seconds later. The system worked smoothly in the first half though, as good possession (a few sensible passes square or backwards meaning Steve&rsquo;s constant prompting is beginning to pay off) led to a succession of spurned chances. Vags finishing this season has been, at times, woeful, no change today but some of the build up play was extremely high quality and lovely to watch. Gabriella might beg to differ of course. A few long shots from Simon and Phil just about reached the keeper and Muzzy missed a great opportunity from a few yards out. Nao also had a memory of his great strike against Albion a couple of months ago but having injured some poor pigeon near the corner flag realised that this was an aberration. The aforementioned Mr. Musgrove went on to miss another couple of good chances in the second half but despite the post match ribbing, he put in another great shift and on 3 occasions chased down and harried defenders into errors which just didn&rsquo;t break the right way.<br>
										<br>
										Maritzio threatened sporadically and usually from long range but Tony was extremely comfortable mopping up in goal. Vags&rsquo; pushing finally paid off when Simon chased down a ball he had no right to win and the ball was worked across goal &#150; Muzzy used his phenomenal upper body strength (so he told me after a couple of beers later) to hold off the defender and the ball made it through to Mr. Doyle. Obviously years spent pretending to get labour laws sorted whilst surreptitiously reading &lsquo;how to score goals&rsquo; under a welter of documents has finally paid off. He did what they say on the telly...got over the ball and drove it DOWN on the volley. A bit too much down really as it bounced up and down and up and down and finally trickled past a feeble effort from the keeper. GET IN! Brian is now our joint third top scorer........on one.<br>
										<br>
										   Second half, Vags nodded off as usual for a good 20 minutes or so but still Maritzio didn&rsquo;t fashion any clear cut chances despite sticking at it and making life difficult. Vags created a few &#150; newbie Amos had a decent effort with practically his first touch of the ball...Paul shot wide a couple of times...a lot of play around the 18 yard box with no end product. This game was a microcosm of Vags season really, with the exception that we didn&rsquo;t let in a couple of daft goals.<br>
										<br>
										Masahiro and Nao put in excellent shifts as wing backs, Paul covered a lot of ground with a lot of skill, Steve was impeccable and constructive from the back &#150; apart from 2 howlers (don&rsquo;t think we didn&rsquo;t notice). Brian and Phil could almost play for the BFC....Simon was energy, not finishing admittedly, but energy.  <br>
										<br>
										Moment of the match award was after Steve blooper #1 though &#150; Ged slid in, in the penalty area - clean, no nonsense and efficient tackle. That&rsquo;s what we like.<br>
										<br>
										Final analysis is job well done and with no little football involved. <br>
										<br>
										Referee Rouven was excellent.<br>
										<br>
										Congrats to Brian most definitely due. (not for the goal)&nbsp;<b><br>
