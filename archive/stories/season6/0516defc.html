									<p><b>Yoyogi NHK, Saturday, May 16th</b><br>
										And with a spectacular 3-3 draw with the Barbarians team, another Division Two season has come to pass for the Dutch.<br>
										<br>
										A peculiar season indeed. For about two months, between January and March, it seemed no other team wanted the second spot in the league, despite the Dutch doing everything they could to give it up.<br>
										Finally that team emerged (Zion, decent blokes) and it is only fitting that the Dutch got 4 out of the 6 points available against them. Alos, congratulations to the excellent and fair playing FC International team for winning the league. Division One teams have their work cut out for them out next year.<br>
										<br>
										But this is not about sour grapes, gentle reader, as promotion to Division One is not something we would wish upon our worst enemy (the english?). For as everybody knows, football is a sport best played with your ego checked out at the door, something many a players in Div ision One seem not to understand.<br>
										<br>
										It is with pleasure indeed that the Oranje team welcomes another League Two season starting this Fall. Nobody in the division will shed a tear seeing Mauricio going down either. <br>
										To make this season perfect, that hubris-infested lions team in division one would need to be relegated, but you can`t have it all I guess.<br>
										<br>
										So what it comes down too is a few months without 11-a side footie, and devoid of the pleasure of reading histerically ego-inflated division one team match reports - really lads, keep it up!<b><br>
