									<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 8th March</b><br>
										
										Groundhog Day with 'The Salmon' spawning a hat-trick as BFC spanked the French 6-1 in what is becoming almost a weekly meeting between the teams.<br>
										<br>
										<b>MANGE TOUT, RODDERS!</b><br>
										<br>
										A bijout stroll down memory lane. Jon Day's first game with the BFC, about eight years ago. Invited along by Sid Lloyd he nervously shuffles from foot to foot about 10 feet from the rest of the players and when finally introduced, I remember his handshake not being the firmest.<br>
										<br>
										We played at somewhere aptly called 'Big Circus' against a bunch of clowns from Brazil who turned up with five players, two pole dancers and dachshund named Colin. Day did not score. My ex-bird, livid at being dragged all that way to watch such a shower of shit, spent 90 minutes painting her nails. Which was quite hot but not entirely the point of this tale.<br>
										<br>
										What happened to the shy, retiring lad who bore a striking resemblance to Roland Gift? These days he is more Roland Rat, nibbling away in the penalty box, at times feeding off scraps but against the French, Day was treated to some silver service from the flanks.<br>
										<br>
										He is of course 'The Salmon' -- technically more of a anadromous water dweller than a furry rodent -- but whatever he is, it took him all of 10 minutes to sniff out an opener, Yamagishi jinking inside from the right and Day sweeping home clinically from eight yards.<br>
										<br>
										<b>ANADROMOUS CHAP</b><br>
										<br>
										For those of you not intimate with the migratory habits of salmon, the term 'anadromous' refers to the fact they are born in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. Whether Day himself was a) born in water, b) ever migrated to the ocean and c) has ever returned to fresh water to reproduce is unclear. I'll ask him one day.<br>
										<br>
										Anyway, moments later -- and having promised not to use the phrase 'deja vu' I have already abjectly failed -- it was 2-0 as Imai broke down the left and crossed for Day to, well, sweep home clinically from eight yards.<br>
										<br>
										In the excitement, Imai tweaked a hamstring that could rule him out of next week's love-in with <b>SECOND-PLACED </b>Hibs (<b><i>breaking news: YCAC just went top</i></b>). Imagine the damage Imai would have done to himself had Day done his now world-famous salmon leap into the net!<br>
										<br>
										Being well outside the six-yard box (where he usually puts down a sleeping bag and cracks open his laptop to surf porn), he would have needed a trampette to reach the net. A bolt upfield from Morson set Day up for his hat-trick, only for the unthinkable to happen, the former BFC skipper (with the ball bobbling horribly on the pristine astroturf) sliced his shot wide with goal at his mercy. Half-fish, half-human then.<br>
										<br>
										Evans, eschewing the boiler suit and balaclava look and thus officially heralding the start of spring, tried his luck from range, Aranda drove one straight into Taylor's Homer Simpson-like midriff and Yamagishi, who had been with Evans on a Roppongi bender the night before, dribbled past lots of players before refusing to pass and losing the ball. A lot.<br>
										<br>
										El Mullito was not impressed, Aranda chewing out Yamagishi and the yapping got worse when a mix-up in the BFC defence presented the French with a goal out of the blue. Bonnet de douche!<br>
										<br>
										<b>LIBIDO ASSAULT</b><br>
										<br>
										A soothing halftime team talk did the trick, although the man from Del Monte forgot to turn up with the oranges. The kit had arrived despite the considerable danger it was going to be taken to a 'libido assault' event in Ginza the night before involving race queens prancing about in underwear crafted out of leather and barbed wire -- so where were the bloody oranges?!<br>
										<br>
										Okay, the number seven shirt had a suspiciously spunky white stain on it and may have to be prematurely retired. Aranda has already refused to wear the offending article again and I can't say I blame him. The rest of the kits passed the Daz 'window test' with flying colours.<br>
										<br>
										BFC's third came via Aranda after a trip on Pomares on the edge of the box. 'Follow it in!' was the call but when the big Paraguayan hits a free kick, it generally stays 'hit' and following it up would involve a clear infringement of copyright laws on Day's trademark leaping salmon move.<br>
										<br>
										Aranda soon made it 4-1, cutting inside to score with a deflected shot from 20 metres after good interplay up front and at this point the floodgates were at breaking point, Sakai popping up at the back post to head against the bar form an acute angle.<br>
										<br>
										More of the same followed, Himmer, by now doing his best 'Chalky Vieira' impression as a holding midfielder, heading a Clarke corner against the bar and then glancing another corner from Aranda just wide.<br>
										<br>
										There was some gorgeous one-touch football being played at this point by BFC -- truly, truly sexy stuff and a deserved fifth goal came when three BFC players went for the same cross, it skidded under Taylor off the post and back off Taylor before Evans poked it over the line.<br>
										<br>
										At the other end, Morson and Doyle were keeping the lid screwed tightly shut before despite the best efforts of Saco and Ryo to offer some charity to the French.<br>
										<br>
										<b>A PLACE TO SPAWN</b><br>
										<br>
										Folklore has it that salmon return to the exact spot where they were born to spawn -- tracking studies have shown this to be true but the nature of how this memory works has long been debated. I can fairly safely confirm Day does not return to Swindon to spawn and his memory works in much the same way mine does, sporadically and triggered by the same pharmaceuticals.<br>
										<br>
										He did return to exactly the same spot to complete his hat-trick, however, eight yards from goal and 'sweeping home clinically' after decent work from Clarke down the right. That's 16 goals for Day this season, four short of YCAC's Tyson Masar -- a bonafide statistic there, sports fans and not some tosh about fish cut-and-pasted from Wikipedia.<br>
										<br>
										You want some more, do you? Well we beat the French about 5-1 in the league recently and then they knocked us 'Roast Beefs' out of the cup a week later, which was really mean because we were on telly and that and they made us look like muppets and the TV crew packed up and left and that. Or sumfink. Or nuffink.<br>
										<br>
										It just rambles, I know. Four days of the World Baseball Classic and that's what you get for your money, folks. This episode of 'House' -- when he leaves the rectal thermometer in his patient and walks out for lunch -- is a particular favourite of mine. You can stop reading whenever you want. No, really. I'm done.<br>
