									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 9th November</b><br>
										The Hibs and France have a colourful history dating back to a time when the TML was not even a twinkle in Sid's eye. So it was good to finally reacquaint ourselves after&nbsp;France's one year hiatus in division two. France FC are a feisty bunch and a game against them is always likely to have its share of thrills, spills and controversy. This one was no different. We&rsquo;ve had some memorable games over the years including the last kick of the game goal that saw us win&nbsp;3-2 Hibs after being down 2-0 down at half time and the 8-5 victory after going down 1-0 to 10 men after two minutes before bouncing back to be 7-1 up at half time. We thought the FFC defense to be solid and would have taken a 1-0 victory before play if it had been offered. Nevertheless we had a very strong squad of 15 with manager Naoki taking the luxury of not even lacing up the boots.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>Early on and Ike skipped by a couple of defenders on the right and floated a great cross over that was headed in for the Hibs to go 1-0 up. Soon after and Tomo exploited the right flank again before sliding a ball across the face of the goal that beat the keeper and Andre had so long to look at it that he played a one-two on the back post before putting it in. Too easy for the Brazilian Bull. Ike played the same trick again and floated one perfectly back post for Kuni K to head in from a close angle unchallenged. Andre finished a PK and one other that I can't remember, Keita a &lsquo;fast break&rsquo; to put us up 6-0. Mercenary Jorge showed that he&rsquo;s not the player you want to stand off when he has the ball on his left foot from 20 yards to send us into HT at 6-1.<br>We were eyeing double figures again but the game deteriorated somewhat in the second half. Hibs playmaker Mike McGirr was given a rest from the start of the half, and his influence on the team was sorely missed as France pulled back two goals back from set pieces. On his day (and this was indeed one of them) Mike McG is the finest player in the league. The two goals served the purpose of increasing the French&rsquo;s hope and inevitably, frustration when decisions went against them. Mild mannered scouse referee Paul (a very nice bloke) tried to embody the English tradition of letting the game flow, but this soon turned into carte-blanche for anyone to smash an opposition players legs to smithereens provided they &ldquo;got the ball sir&rdquo; (at least a little bit of it). Emotions rose and the game teetered on the brink of going out of control. After Tomo beat the offside trap (by about five metres) to make it 8 with a classic goal preceded by a dozen or more passes, the ref was forced to endure a French midfielder shout in his face from about 2cm for a full two minutes. Even a yellow card one minute in did not stop the fiery blue&rsquo;s facial tirade. Most TMLer&rsquo;s will know that this scribe is not shy of letting a referee know his opinion but watching someone who was in the wrong carrying on like this was enough to make me want to just stick to rugby. There is something about soccer that sees reason go out the window sometimes.<br>
										So, another high scoring performance from the Hibs and another three points in the bag sees us happy as a pig in poop. With 18 points from six games, that bar a contentious appeal to a dismiss an awarded forfeit, would have been 21 from seven sees us in pole position for the run in. We&rsquo;re hoping to continue the good form well into the new year and claim the TML crown for the third time. This current squad could be our best ever so let&rsquo;s hope we can keep them all on the park.<br>
