									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 5th October</b><br>
										Lions first Division 1 match at last kicks off, and with a crucial society event, Lions were missing a handful of key players, including the reliable left back Mo Birkia, his dribbling maestro of a brother - Abu, the talented tall striker Zuhair, the Captain Gaafar Somi, and the super keeper - Orlando (and more!).... <br>
										This was an opportunity to hand a couple of new potential players their chance to shine. <br>
										Nevertheless, Lions were just 12 on the day, with the only striker available, Ahmed Gaafar, suffering a slight groin strain during the warm up. Ahmed was thrown in, and although he performed well, his blistering pace was restrained with the niggling injury. <br>
										Lions reverted to a back 3, and a compact 6 midfielders due to the availability of players. <br>
										The game started well, and within 10 minutes, Ken Hersche almost put Lions ahead, but a brave save from France's keeper Taylor, denied the Lion's ace. Another chance was fashioned on the right, and as a drilled cross found its way through, an over-stretched Ken, could not capitalise on the chance, with Ahmed slotting wide. <br>
										The impressive Hideki place a beauty of a through pass to Ahmed, who found himself one-on-one with Taylor, but credit to the keeper, he made a great save, with the ball falling to Hideki, who then re-played the ball back to Ahmed, who this time made sure Lions go 1-0 up, deservedly. <br>
										The 2 new centre-backs, Sho, and Tatsu, were very impressive, where every ball played in the box, were headed out superbly by the high flying defenders. <br>
										A moment of hesitation, saw a France player break the offside trap, credit to the Lions' linesman, who after flagging a player offside, saw the onside players' run and put his flag down, to allow France to round the standin keeper Taiki and level the game at 1-1. <br>
										The second half saw the only Lions change with Ahmed coming off, and Ken thrown upfront in the lone striker position. <br>
										France almost scored from a 40-yarder aimed to catching Taiki off-gaurd, but luckily the back paddling Taiki saw the ball sit on the top of the net. <br>
										Jorge Kuriyama had a magnificent 25 yard free-kick dipping into the bottom left corner, but Taiki pulled the save of the match, turning it safely into a corner. <br>
										Lions then played a through pass, with Hideki breaking the offside trap, and crossing for Ken who powered his header past a helpless Taylor. The goal however was ruled offside by the France linesman, who insisted that he was unaware of the 'non-interfering offiside rule', despite 30 minutes earlier, the Lions' linesman allowed France to score exactly the same goal! <br>
										Lions players and coaches were furious, but the referee still dismissed the goal. <br>
										With Tatsuya playing for the first time in the 'Makalele' position, protecting the back 3 along with Fahad, he was gold for Lions, till a slight injury forced him out. Lions then became under pressure, with Tatsuya's absence affecting the game. <br>
										With Ahmed forced back into the game for the injured Tatsuya, a counter attack with clever side switching saw Omar lay the ball across the 'D', only for the struggling Ahmed to drill home a low shot past Taylor, to make it 2-1 to Lions with 5 minutes to go. <br>
										Ahmed feeling the effect of his scorcher, was replaced for the second time by Tatsuya, who soldiered on for the remaining few minutes. <br>
										With a few new players, Lions played a very attractive fast game, with France defenders having to continously break the through runs, with Lions fashioning an attack almost every minute! <br>
										A fast-paced, 'Arsenal-like' game with very athletic new players, earned Lions a perfect start, and with new players impressing, and with returning players, surely Lions' season can only get better. <br>
										Man of the Match: Tatsuya Ando in the new position (discovered by Mo in 7s)<br>
