									<p><b>YCAC, Sunday, April 26th</b><br>
										Sala FC&rsquo;s hopes of concluding the season at the dizzy heights of number 4 were severely dashed at the weekend by a typically stoic Kanto Celts performance &#150; 2 goals carved out with minimum effort by the Celts prompted little response from a tired looking Sala.<br>
										<br>
										Conditions at the YCAC wind terminal had settled after a perfect storm a day earlier, only a puddle or 2 lining the pristine playing arena were a reminder of what had been.  The stage was set for a Sala reply to the comprehensive defeat suffered at the first meeting between the sides 3 months previously.  Spongy pitch conditions had played a major part during that encounter, only the sponging of Sala tears after yet another undoing at the hands of 2 soft goals were witnessed on Sunday night.<br>
										<br>
										The game commenced at pace, Sala FC enjoying plenty of the possession in midfield while the Celts chased, closed down and broke up any real chance of penetrating the experienced back line.  The 3-5-2 formation now firmly nailed into the heads of the Sala personnel threatened by allowing the rejuvenated Brooke-Smith freedom to pick up and distribute with ease, teasing the Celts left flank with delicate passing to release the tireless Take, who guarded as well as advanced the right wing with characteristic fortitude.  Yusuke, advancing from his defensive position, almost stamped his name on the Sala goal of the season award by unleashing a sweet drive from 30 yards &#150; it dipped, fizzed and curved, skimming the far post and alarming the honorable Mr. Delsaux who, as a testimonial to the Norwich FC team of 1993/4, decided to sport it&rsquo;s goalkeeping uniform from that season.<br>
										<br>
										Reacting positively to pressure and capitalizing on errors has always been a component to the well stocked Celts armory.  The dynamic duo of McGill playing a newer role as an attacking full-back with the spring footed Monahan in a freer central midfield quietly absorbed the heightened rate of passing displayed by Sala in the first half.  Only a sprinkling of intermittent weaved, measured and lofted passes could be achieved through the more creatively minded Celts players, one of which resulted in a contentious penalty decision.  <br>
										<br>
										A quick turn by the Celts striker after receiving the ball to feet was met by a strong challenge by the Sala FC defender inside the box.  The close marking and focused nature which had epitomized the Sala defensive strategy to that point proved to be its downfall when the striker was felled and consequently awarded the spot kick.  The resultant effort met the post, rebounded back into the arms of the grateful goalie.  <br>
										<br>
										A series of corner kicks towards the end of the first half saw Sala FC come close with a mis-directed header from Clarke at the far post.  An industrious run producing a drilled cross cut back cross from the dangerous Take also saw Swinney fail to capitalize after losing his marker and scuffing the shot on goal.  A 0-0 score line remained as the first half drew to its conclusion, and with 3 points well within the sights of both teams it was difficult to imagine a goalless score line at the final whistle.<br>
										<br>
										Changes to the Sala line up saw Jelley move back into the right side of a three man central defense, the newly doctored Captain Geisler into to midfield partnering Thomson and Swinney moving just behind the front 2 of Anderson and Harlow.  Almost a mirrored occurrence of the first half initial 15 minutes ensued with passing fluidity oozing from the feet of the refreshed Sala players.  Quick interchange from the defense into the feet of the Sala 5 man midfield failed to find the front men on too many occasions, poor quality in the final 3rd allowed the Celts to calmly weather the premature Sala onslaught and gradually claw their way back into the Sala half.<br>
										<br>
										Celts countered by bringing wide players into the game and releasing their dangerous left winger with more frequency.  Space opening up in the midfield was seized upon by the Celts who initiated phase 2 of the counter attack.  This comprised early balls delivered tellingly into the spaces left by the Sala wing backs which were then met by hungry offensive wide players.  Sharp changes of pace in these positions were proving all too much for the Sala markers as tiredness crept into the ranks.  A lofted pass into the dangerous Celts forward was expertly taken down, a one touch turn followed as did a very well taken effort into the back of the net. 1 &#150; 0.<br>
										<br>
										A brief resurgence from Sala saw young, hungry Harlow receive a flighted delivery from the right flank.  6 yards out and beating the Celts off side trap, the youngster proceeded to bring the ball down and finish the move with an equalizer.  The attempt was subsequently cancelled out after being penalized for handball; the de-moralised striker could only shrug his shoulders and feel a little hard done by.  <br>
										<br>
										The game now moving into its final phase, Celts were now moving into phase 3.  The &ldquo;nail in the coffin&rdquo; phase.  Continued attacking from the wings forced several throw ins from dangerous positions.  A long throw into the Sala penalty box was met by a mis-timed header, the ball remained precariously suspended in the air while several Celts players reacted by moving into more threatening positions, a second attempt was then made to clear the ball as it returned to the fray but could only be directed straight into the path of the oncoming Celts striker.  A chanced, out stretched toe poke squeezed the ball past the outstretched Sala keeper making it 2 &#150; 0.  <br>
										<br>
										Sala, quietly sensing another 3 points snatched away, could only try to continue to drive forwards and mount pressure on the Celts back line.  This wasn&rsquo;t to be, the game quickly moved into the twilight stage, dwindling energy reserves gradually sapping any intensity out of the game.  Chances for both teams became few and far between and the Sala misery was finally extinguished with the final whistle, harsh to the Sala ears but a sweet melody to the deserved winners on the night.  Kanto Celts.<br>
										<br>
										I shall conclude my talk of stages and phases with the conclusion stage of this report by summing up the match with a Trevor Brooking Quote:<br>
										&ldquo;It&rsquo;s end to end stuff, but from side to side&rdquo;   <br>
