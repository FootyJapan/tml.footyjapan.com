					<h1 class="navy">Clash Get First Win for New Sponsor</h1>
					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 21st December</b><br>
						On a balmy December night in Saitama the Clash earned a long overdue first victory of the season by defeating the Dutch 2-1 in a hard fought encounter. Following a missed penalty from the Dutch, Andy Gill opened the scoring for the Clash with a stunning goal midway through the first half. It was 2-0 at the break after Rob Keyworth coolly put away a back-post header.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1221rwc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						36, 40, 44, 52, 41, 42, 48, 35, 42, 23, 47. No, it's not the bust measurements of the finalists in the Miss Pneumatic Universe contest (How did the near-death anorexic Miss 23 get in there? Has Miss 52 got a MySpace page?), no, actually it's the ages for the starting line-up that the appropriately named Albion Old Boys put out in their magnificently gutsy 2-1 win over the appallingly mis-named Dutch Embassy F.C. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1213aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 13th December</b><br>
						BFC&nbsp;went into this game confident that if we played&nbsp;our best&nbsp;we could beat&nbsp;the in-form Hibs. Instead, we came away with nothing, although, to a man, you couldn't fault the effort. It was a massive game for both clubs and&nbsp;everyone knew what was at stake. If BFC lost so they lost their title. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1213bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 13th December</b><br>
						With the usual writer Bevan swapping the sun and beaches of Phuket for&nbsp;stupid amounts of snow in Hokkaido, the match reports from Hibs have become non-existent.&nbsp; The obvious choice to step up and do them would be our very own journo, Jay, but he seems to be a bit too busy entertaining his pet cat, or more likely on&nbsp;his own&nbsp;prowl in Roppongi or wherever it is you go to look for girls of the loose variety.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1213hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hodogaya Koen, Saturday 6th December</b><br>
						Sixteen consenting Vagabonds passed up the chance to go a-berrying and a-mushrooming in the woods on this fine autumn day for a 9am game against Zion. They may still be regretting that choice, losing 3-5 in what was probably their most disorganized performance so far this season. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1206vags.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
