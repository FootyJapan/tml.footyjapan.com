									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 26th October</b><br>
										3 weeks in a row we have made our way out to Misato and all we received was a poxy two points from the first two games. Not that we were grumbling mind, we were happy to take on the top team and come away with a draw and despite a hard fought game a draw against Sun Utd was a blessing. So, that brings us to this week&rsquo;s game.<br>
										<br>
										I have to admit that we were approaching the game with a little excitement. I imagine a lot of the teams and their captains check the TML league standings and it was nice to see we were facing a team on the other end of the scale, for a change!<br>
										Having been the third divisions whipping boys last season we are very keen not to repeat it, even it was always only by one goal!!<br>
										<br>
										So we arrived at the pitch nice and early as usual only to watch the tail end of the game before us. Still, the start was worth waiting for.<br>
										<br>
										Virtually 3 minutes in to the game Jon received a ball from a cross or corner (can&rsquo;t remember which!!) and nodded it in for the first goal. Less than a minute later we were attacking into the box where our player was taken down, the ref pointed to the spot and Jon took the kick and scored a well placed penalty.<br>
										<br>
										King George, not wanting to sit back and take this, put forward their mid field and strikers in an attempt to win back some valuable goals. However, Romen (Benitez)&rsquo;s formation stopped them from coming too far forward and our midfield held with strength and our defenders easily cleared the few balls that came through. To say that Dan, first time in goal, had an easy time of it really doesn&rsquo;t do our defenders justice, to say the least we were solid at the back.<br>
										<br>
										Not wanting to take only two goals from the game we pushed forward as new recruit Scott mangled his first touch from a passed ball, but sublimely took his second touch to score with the Panthers third of the game.<br>
										<br>
										Half time came and went and we went back onto the pitch with even more desire to score. Jon not happy with two goals of his own, started stealing other people goals. A long ball from Yuseppe, destined for the middle of the goal due to the position of the goalie left Jon in the enviable position of tapping in his third, at this point I can&rsquo;t even remember how he scored his fourth! Still, we weren&rsquo;t resting and a beautiful ball splitting two midfielders from myself, left Alan in a little space. A beautiful cross left the defenders wrong footed and accidentally their player nodded the ball past his own keeper into the net.<br>
										<br>
										Our Captain smelling blood decided to get in on the goal scoring action and after a magnificent shot blasted the back of the net. Panther 6, King George 0.<br>
										<br>
										I would like to point out that having forgot my pencil and pad in the car this week I couldn&rsquo;t remember everything and after nearly stealing the net on the way out of Misato my mind displaced most of the game. Suffice to say we all had a nice time winning and long may it continue!!<br>
