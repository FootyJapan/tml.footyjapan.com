									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 1st February</b><br>
										With a collective age of around half a millennium, &nbsp;it's understandable that over the years the Albion Old Boys have picked up more than their share of bad footballing habits, some of which, like regularly bringing a chocolate-coloured toy poodle to watch you play, are far too embarrassing to even mention here (so Karl Twohig can rest assured that his secret is safe with us). <br>
										But one bad habit the Varicose Veterans have rarely displayed in the time that this reporter has been playing for them is to concede costly late goals. Yet at YCAC on Sunday the Old Boys did exactly that for the second week in a row, this time allowing the home team the only goal of a game that Albion should have won comfortably.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A bright blue Sunday morning sky provided an excellent colour contrast for the Old Boy's first sight of the shiny new green YCAC astroturf, impressive to look at and a joy to play on compared to the worn-out used-to-be-grass-in-the-Meiji-Era surface it replaced. So having seen technology turn a lunar landscape into a billiard table, the never-satisfied old grouches in the Old Boys team then started to ask when the YCAC would address the other natural hazard that all too-often makes playing there a less-than-pleasant experience. A fifty-foot-high wooden fence to enclose the ground on all four sides? A massive engineering project to bring Yamate Bluff back down to sea level? Or talking about sea, how about moving that ocean back a few miles? Whatever is decided, something needs to be done about that huffing puffing effing wind. Because not for the first time here, with a hard cold gale blowing down the pitch from the clubhouse end, it was the wind more than any of the participants that dominated the game.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In the first half it was the Old Boys who played with the wind pinning them back into their own end of the pitch. YCAC found it easy to get forward momentum, but not so easy to get through a well-organized Albion defence. In fact the only two good chances the home team had both came from wind-assisted inswinging corners; one curled directly onto the Albion crossbar before being scrambled away, another found a YCAC player on the six-yard line who will be disappointed not to have buried his header. Yet the best chance of the half fell to Albion, Sam Chamovitz one-on-one with the YCAC keeper who did really well to get down and palm away a shot that was heading inside his left-hand post.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Second half, and now it was time for those few YCAC lads that have hair left to get it blown backwards like Leonardo and Kate on the prow of the Titanic. The Old Boys did a better job of taking advantage of the wind, and with Naoki Ogasawara getting his passing mojo working Albion created several good chances. Cyrille Segalini performed a pirouette en dehors followed by an arabesque followed by a tour de basque as he danced his way past a string of YCAC defenders inside the box, yet once again the YCAC keeper won the one-on-one with another great low save. And Cyrille was involved again in a great move when he took Naoki's through ball and laid it on for Sam, who drew the defenders in before squaring it for Hitoshi Ono, who made sure the keeper wouldn't get a hand on his shot by firing it the wrong side of the post. And having failed to take those and a few other decent chances the Old Boys were made to pay dearly in the dying minutes when YCAC scored with their only shot on target in the second half. Quite a shot though, as a YCAC corner found Karl Hahne unmarked on the edge of the box and the veteran striker showed a flash of the old magic to fire in a net-bulging half-volley.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So following on from Jetro's late equalizer last week that's five points out of six that the big-hearted Old Boys have donated to their opponents in the last eight days, yet with the first half of the season's fixtures finally complete they're still comfortably in the top half of the Division 2 table. Which has got to be worth a few beers, right? And so with the clubhouse forming a perfect windbreak and Mount Fuji in the February sunshine seeming to loom large enough beside us to reach out and touch, it was almost T-shirt weather on the YCAC patio as the pitchers kept flowing well into the afternoon, the game (what game?) a quickly-forgotten prelude to the real event.<br>
