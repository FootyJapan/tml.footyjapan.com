									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 15th February</b><br>
										It's that time again, doomseekers and sadists!&nbsp; When Scorchio pens another tale of what could have been and what nearly was for poor old Sala FC.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 3-2&nbsp;defeat to YCAC was the bottom line this time.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										BUT, I'm sure everyone is getting tired of all these&nbsp;hard luck stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I certainly am,&nbsp;and I had to play in all the&nbsp;fargin matches (alert Oxford to the possible creation of a new word).&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;a few&nbsp;possible ways around writing about another&nbsp;gloomy loss for Sala.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										To start with, I could write this report about the first 70 minutes&nbsp;ONLY.&nbsp; Then it would ineed be a different story.&nbsp; No&nbsp;pain and misery,&nbsp;and an actual&nbsp;victory for Sala, plus 3&nbsp;golden points on the board.&nbsp; Alas, footy is an 80 minute game (in the TML) and that&nbsp;version of events&nbsp;would, quite simply, not be&nbsp;true.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Or, I could just write about the time I nearly got married to a nubile bride in the Himalayan mountains of Nepal.&nbsp; THAT is a&nbsp;true story but irrelevant I fear.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Or, I could write about the delights of bobbing for apples with a group of naked lesbians (think about it for a second, my friends) but that wouldn't be scientific, as I have never done it and therefore I have no facts whatsoever relating to the matter.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So, it looks like we are buggered then!&nbsp; Truth, relevance&nbsp;and&nbsp;facts it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										On to&nbsp;the doom, gloom and testicles in a vice then.&nbsp; Sala started with no Guido, Clarkey, Ian or Dave at the back, and Shige missing in midfield.&nbsp; So, it was a makeshift defence of&nbsp;Dan, Yusuke and Lenny that&nbsp;commenced the match.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, things&nbsp;began badly for them with Yusuke almost putting the ball into his own net when attempting to clear a cross in the first minute.&nbsp; Then, from the subsequent corner, YCAC nearly netted a quick opener, the ball floating across the goal and drifting inches&nbsp;wide of the far post.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, after that, the defence found their feet, and, actually, did a damn good job for&nbsp;the rest of the half.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So, what could Sala's midfielders and strikers do then??&nbsp; Well, Pete (arguably the best player in the team) couldn't even turn up on time, so that didn't bode well for the rest of Sala's motley crew.&nbsp; However, Sala did start to take control of the game territorially and in possession,&nbsp;despite the fact that&nbsp;their short passing&nbsp;game was pretty rank.&nbsp; Shiva and Scotty being the main culprits.&nbsp; Having spent the previous Friday out all&nbsp;night together and up to their eye-balls in sin, it was a wonder that they didn't have a better understanding.&nbsp; Alas, why can nothing good&nbsp;ever come out of Roppongi!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Happily for them, tardy Pete and miraculously 100% fit Brookey passed the ball a lot better.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sala's first real&nbsp;shot&nbsp;on target came from Sam,&nbsp;who was put through on the right by Toby, but the YCAC keeper made a good block, and Sala couldn't capitalise&nbsp;from the resultant corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Booo hisss went the fans.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The first half was drawing to a&nbsp;close with both teams level, when&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;(stand in Captain in Guido's absence) produced a master stroke.&nbsp; He pulled down his trousers and stroked his........sorry, I jest!&nbsp; He brought&nbsp;young whippersnapper, Ryo, into the fray, and he immediately had an impact,&nbsp;sucking players in and taking the ball for mazy&nbsp;wee dribbles on the left.&nbsp; This was the kind of threat that Sala needed, and it bore fruit&nbsp;the next&nbsp;time Ryo collected the ball.&nbsp; Beating his man on the edge of the box, he cut in from the left and fired a shot towards the bottom corner.&nbsp; The keeper&nbsp;blocked it but somehow the ball zinged off his hands at a wacky angle and into the net.&nbsp; Hurrah went the fans!!&nbsp; Well, not the 20 or so&nbsp;home YCAC&nbsp;supporters. But the 6 Sala fans, who consisted of&nbsp;Sala legend, Brian Harlow, his wife, Akimi, their legion of 3 sprogs, and Shun's girlfriend all went ape.&nbsp; Fun for all the family.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										1-0 Sala at halftime.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half was much more exciting, with no less than 4 goals.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Again, Sam was the first Sala player to have a shot on target, but&nbsp;one wonders&nbsp;how the game would have finished had&nbsp;Sam squared the ball earlier to a wide-open and umarked Stu, instead of shooting himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a big&nbsp;chance that wasn't taken.&nbsp; Still, it's hard to knock strikers for shooting when that's&nbsp;what they're put out there to do.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And so it materialised&nbsp;that YCAC equalised a few minutes later, after Scotty and Shiva&nbsp;dealt with a goal kick in the&nbsp;most horrible&nbsp;way, gifting the ball to YCAC,&nbsp;who put their danger man, Yoshioka, through on goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sala keeper, Shun, hesitated then came, but all in all it was too late, and the YCAC striker deflty clipped the ball over him.&nbsp; 1-1.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										True to recent&nbsp;improvements, Sala didn't spit the dummy and go into a funk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, they took the game to YCAC, big Stu curling a shot just&nbsp;past the top corner, and Ryo nearly repeating his first half goal with a similar dribble and shot.&nbsp; Just desserts were served though when Sala&nbsp;struck again minutes later.&nbsp; Having earned a corner, Brookey swung in a great ball, which Pete met firmly with&nbsp;a&nbsp;nice header into the old onion bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal was celebrated with extra enthusiasm due to&nbsp;Pete's recent return after&nbsp;almost a year out with injury.&nbsp; 2-1 Sala.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At this point,&nbsp;Sala should have shut up shop, but they didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;A move to 4-4-2 would have been&nbsp;the wiser option, as would have some team members not partying&nbsp;until all hours of the morning the Friday before.&nbsp; Maybe then&nbsp;Sala would have had&nbsp;enough stamina to finish the job.&nbsp; And so it was, just like Arsenal (without&nbsp;quite so much&nbsp;flair it must be said)&nbsp;Sala&nbsp;totally blew their one goal lead in the last 10 minutes, and succumbed to a&nbsp;2 goal&nbsp;blitz from YCAC's other danger man, Tyson, to lose&nbsp;spectularly 3-2.&nbsp; I would like to recant all that occurred in the two YCAC moves that led to their goals, but&nbsp; it's late and I can't be arsed.&nbsp; Plus, there's wine to be drunk and apples to be bobbed!&nbsp; Perhaps next week&nbsp;I shall&nbsp;write about those lesbos with facts in the bags, but until then, suffice to say,&nbsp; YCAC never gave up, Sala gave up a whole lot,&nbsp;and in the end the best team lost but the two best players won.<br>
