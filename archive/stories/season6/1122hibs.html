									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 22nd November</b><br>
										Very occasionally a match comes along that is has it all. A game that can be the source of bar-room banter for years to come as the great moments and controversy are remembered time and time again. This was not one of them. <br>
										In fact it was a bit of a bore. Fortunately a well lubricated train ride back and post game festivities in some watering hole in the boondocks saved the evening from complete tedium. A 2 hour train ride saw the Hibs arrive half asleep and not even a shot of caffeine could spring us into the game, while The Jets began well, full of industry and purpose. The Jets pressing forward in numbers, but lacked the extra something to really trouble Hitoshi. <br>
										<br>
										The first goal came about fifteen minutes in as Yama won the ball in the middle and played in Ike who overlapped well on the right and fed the ball to Tomo who received it in the box with his back to goal. He was tightly marked but used strength and speed to turn and fire in a shot that beat the keeper at his near post. A deserved goal for JRs platinum frequent flyer card holder who has been behind a lot of the Hibs great play that Andre, Edu and McGirr have been grabbing the headlines for thus far this season.<br>
										Edu then threaded through a ball down the middle that everyone thought was going to be delivered to a wide man and live-wire Yama found himself one on one with keeper and he steadied and finished well. The game meandered along with poor ball control by both teams making it a less than stunning spectacle.&nbsp; Two - Nil at half time and eventually we went 3-0 up when McGirr was fouled by the keeper as he went around him. Sure he&nbsp;went down&nbsp;a bit easily but the keeper did clatter into him and stopped a definate goal - stud marks on his thigh were testament to the obvious foul and penalty. <br>
										Andre smacked it in - easy as you like. Keita picked up two late yellows in quick succession for niggly but cynical fouls. We&rsquo;ll miss him in our upcoming game against Sala.<br>
										The Jets pulled one back late with a thunderous strike from inside the box by half time sub Sam that gave Hitoshi no hope. The same player drew an athletic save from Hitoshi with a 30 yard screamer. In the end we were happy to walk away with the three goals, three points and move onto Phuket where we&rsquo;re aiming for the three-peat. Another dozen wins and we&rsquo;ll become the first team to win three TML crowns.<br>
