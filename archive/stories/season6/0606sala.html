									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Saturday, June 6th</b><br>
										What would&nbsp;football be without controversy??&nbsp; Probably&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;the best sport in the world ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what&nbsp;would football&nbsp;be&nbsp;with some controversy&nbsp;but no diving??&nbsp; Definitely, the best sport in the world ever.......&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										After a&nbsp;ding donger&nbsp;battle royal both teams went away from this match with a point,&nbsp; having served up an enthralling&nbsp;1-1 draw.&nbsp; But, it must be said,&nbsp;Sala&nbsp;went away with something extra.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp;bad taste in their mouths.&nbsp; What was that taste you ask??&nbsp; That&nbsp;of another man's urine in their Carlsberg!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Read on readers for there is a twist in this sordid tale.<br>
										<br>
										Early possession and 3 or 4 corners saw BFC in the driving seat for the first 5 mins, but after this, Sala's tireless running up front and in midfield, started to cause the BFC defenders to make mistakes at the back, and the BFC midfield soon vanished like a ninja&nbsp;up a wizard's sleeve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										From this point to half time Sala were in the ascendancy.&nbsp; Rob Harlow, finishing the season on a hot streak,&nbsp;sent a&nbsp;blistering left foot shot whistling&nbsp;just over the BFC goal.&nbsp; This was an ominous warning and sure enough he broke the deadlock minutes later.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding space on the left, Guido switched play with a brilliant&nbsp;crossfield ball to Take.&nbsp; Take played it early to the&nbsp;ever industrious Pete Swinney who&nbsp;chipped it infield to Rob on the edge of the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinney gave Rob the shout to turn and before you could say&nbsp;&quot;Watch out! There's a sniper active around here&quot; Rob&nbsp;chested the ball on the turn and lashed a dipping right foot volley over the&nbsp;helpless BFC keeper.&nbsp; <br>
										<b>Sala 1-0.</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sala then came close from a corner with danger man, Dave, setting up Clarkey whose attempt was cleared from the 6 yard box.&nbsp; Next, Scotty almost latched onto a tantalising ball across the 6 yard box from Take who was causing all sorts of trouble down the right flank.&nbsp; Despite being on top though in the first half Sala lacked the quality required in the final third to extend their lead.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And so it was that Sala went in with their heads held high and a deserved 1-0 lead come the half time whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										But, just like a threesome,&nbsp;football is a game of two halves, and in the second 45 mins BFC came out&nbsp;all&nbsp;guns blazing like a supercharged TNT guns of the Navarone powderkeg of football.&nbsp; Whereas Sala were more like a new born armidillo.&nbsp; All shell with only a few spikes worth mentioning.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Immediately, a BFC striker was sent clean through but he blazed over when a placed finish would have been far wiser.&nbsp; Soon after, BFC's Shousuke dribbled in from the right and lashed a shot at the Sala goal.&nbsp; Veteran keeper Andy Cross managed to get a scaley claw to it though,&nbsp;and pushed it onto the post.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At this point Sala&nbsp;launched a series of counters.&nbsp; Stu caused a BFC defender to miss clearing a long ball and Rob raced through on the keeper.&nbsp; Looking odds on to score he was just about to pull the trigger when the BFC captain, James, made a great recovery tackle forcing the Sala striker to fluff his shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the resultant corner, Stu proved that white men from Barrhead can jump, glancing a lovely header a bawhair above the top corner.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;Rob fizzed another howitzer shot just off target.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Normal service resumed though and BFC attacked again.&nbsp; Another shot flashed in from the left this time, only&nbsp;for Andy &quot;You ain't seen nothin yet&quot; Cross to palm it onto his favourite&nbsp;left post.&nbsp; Carlos Aranda was next to threaten the Sala goal with a peach of a curling shot from outside the box which thunked off the stanchion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At this point the seige on Sala's goal was getting ridiculous,&nbsp;with BFC having hit the post 3 times,&nbsp;possessed about 70% of the second half ball and caused about 8&nbsp;corners,&nbsp; irrespective of&nbsp;Sala's dangerous counters.&nbsp; However, despite deserving a goal the score still remained at 1-0 to Sala.&nbsp; And, it was for this reason that&nbsp;what happened next was so unfair on&nbsp;Sala, as no matter how much&nbsp;a team deserves an equaliser nobody ever deserves to score from a penalty gained through diving.&nbsp; Unfortunatley, for Sala this is what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of BFC's strikers, who&nbsp;shall remain nameless, wriggled past 2 defenders in the box then&nbsp;took a theatrical tumble.&nbsp; The referee made an honest call and called it the way he saw it; penalty.&nbsp; But, to the group of&nbsp;Sala palyers camped in their own box it was a clear dive, and the BFC players close to the incident knew that, too.&nbsp; Carlos stepped up and nonchalantly stroked home the spot kick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										<b>1-1</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Both teams looked for the winner in the last 10 mins but Sala's lack of quality in the final was again their main problem, and the game finished one apiece.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Anyway, it's started to rain and my soapbox is getting slippery, so I'm going to step down and end&nbsp;any foolish ranting before it really gets&nbsp;started.&nbsp; So, sleep well readers, and don't worry as we'll all be back next year for another dose of the TML clap.&nbsp; Well, everyone that is apart from the divers, I hope.&nbsp; They're scabby enough already!!<br>
