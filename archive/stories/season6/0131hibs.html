									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 31st January</b><br>
										24 hours.&nbsp; Lots can happen in 24 hours.&nbsp; I surely will never forget 31st January 2009.&nbsp; The day started with me scheduled to referee 2 matches at Hachioji from 9 am.&nbsp; Wake up to the most delightful winter weather Japan has to offer.&nbsp; The second of&nbsp;2 consecutive days of freezing rain and&nbsp;window shaking winds.&nbsp; A quick mail to TML to confirm&nbsp;what everybody&nbsp;already knows about the matches being cancelled due to a flooded pitch, but to my surprise the matches are going ahead.&nbsp; Damn! (enter more appropriate expletives here)&nbsp;would be my first thought after realizing I&nbsp;&nbsp;had to get&nbsp;out of my semi-warm bed to stand around in the late January rain at 9 am.&nbsp; Oh well, if Barbarians and Vagabonds are willing to play in it, I guess I can pile the clothes on and try to referee in it.&nbsp; So, reluctantly out the door and on my way to Hachioji.&nbsp; Pull up to Hachioji only to find what should have been expected, the pitch 90% under water.&nbsp; All I wanted at that moment was to be in my bed...A call to TML to let them know that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th matches of the day had a better chance of holding a swim meet than a football match.&nbsp; Even with Hibs meant to play the 6th and final match of the day, I was resigned to not having a match in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										Straight back home for a hot shower and the news that&nbsp;since I don't have&nbsp;to referee then I get to go to the hospital for a check up with the&nbsp;missus. (more on that later)&nbsp; 3 hours spent looking at Where's Waldo books... <br>
										Home again and ready to catch up on lost sleep, but the rain had stopped and TML was not going to let Hachioji go unused.&nbsp; News was that Sala and Celts players were sweeping rain off the pitch and the last two matches were going ahead as planned.&nbsp; This meant&nbsp;going back to Hachioji and trying to&nbsp;get focused to play&nbsp;with only 11 players against a very scrappy&nbsp;Lions team.&nbsp; This is the same team that we drew with a few&nbsp;weeks ago and I&nbsp;think we all&nbsp;knew this was going to be another tough match.&nbsp; Half of the pitch was in good condition, but the other half had a pool on the edge of the box and wasn't going to be very helpful to our passing style.&nbsp;&nbsp;We defended the&nbsp;wetter end first and&nbsp;our defenders must have looked like&nbsp;complete fools with clearances going about 10 yards.&nbsp; The only advantage was&nbsp;that their quick&nbsp;forwards and wingers had to try to dribble through the same area.&nbsp; A pretty calm first half finished 1-0&nbsp;with our new Peter Crouch-like forward, Ryan, finishing off a good move and slotting&nbsp;past the keeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, things picked up&nbsp;in the second half, with chances at both ends.&nbsp; The first main talking point was a good move by&nbsp;Lions where the ball was played out to the right side to their skillful Japanese mi dfielder.&nbsp; He&nbsp;looked to be through on goal, but&nbsp;was expertly&nbsp;cut down by the Hibs left back (yes, I'm&nbsp;the Hibs left back).&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball was somewhere in the neighborhood and the tackle wasn't high or particularly dangerous, but&nbsp;the Lions player made sure to make it extra dramatic with no less than 6 rolls after the foul.&nbsp; Lions players&nbsp;wanted a straight red,&nbsp;moaning about it being the last man and it being a 2 footed tackle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sure what they were&nbsp;watching, but I wasn't&nbsp;the last man nor was it 2 footed.&nbsp; Foul, clearly.&nbsp; Bookable offence, yes.&nbsp; Take your free kick and let's get on with the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictably after the yellow card was given, the player that was fouled stopped&nbsp;his rolling around on the ground and took the free kick.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it wasn't cleared and a Lions player was first to the rebound and punished us for our mistake.&nbsp; <br>
										1-1 and Lions&nbsp;were clearly lifted after the goal.&nbsp; <br>
										Orlando was reminding his players that the game was still there to be won and Hibs were&nbsp;rocked back a bit&nbsp;by the goal.&nbsp; We did however start to get a grip on the game thanks&nbsp;to&nbsp;the tireless running of Andre, Tomo, Ryan and Kuni, among others. Hibs scored the next goal getting in behind the defence and&nbsp;sliding it past Orlando.&nbsp; The referee ignored the Lions claim for offsides, as they had no linesman.&nbsp; Shortly after we added a&nbsp;third, which&nbsp;finally finished the Lions off.&nbsp; Still time for 1 more to make the final scoreline a bit flattering.&nbsp; So, second half goals from Andre, Ed, and Tomo helped us get back to winning ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;The referee Paul did a great job&nbsp;with&nbsp;a tough fixture and will clearly be welcomed by the TML community.&nbsp; <br>
										So back home for the 4th time of the day and ready to relax,&nbsp;only to find out that&nbsp;my pregnant missus has&nbsp;starte d&nbsp;having pains in her stomach.&nbsp;&nbsp;To the hospital for the 2nd time of the day and&nbsp;the next time I would be going home as a father.&nbsp;&nbsp;In bed at 4 am, physically and emotionally shattered.&nbsp; What a day! &nbsp;<br>
