									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 8th February</b><br>
										<br>
										Well, the headline says it all.&nbsp; Sala fought hard and battled admirably, but in&nbsp;the end, were outplayed by a&nbsp;classy intelligent&nbsp;footballing team and last year's deserved champions.&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical laser beam shot from Carlos Aranda, a header from BFC new guy, Mike, and two poachers goals from Jon Day, proved&nbsp;more than enough for BFC to take the points.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In fairness to Sala though, 4-0 was a harsh scoreline&nbsp;considering the 3rd and 4th goals were gifts coming from&nbsp;poor Sala mistakes.&nbsp; And, continuing on a&nbsp;positive note,&nbsp;Sala's&nbsp;performance was a fitting answer to their Captain's request for more passion and fight than the team had shown the previous week against Kanto Celts.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
										This match was&nbsp;definetely a step in the right direction for Sala, in terms of passion, spirit and hard running.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The match began with Dave and Scotty both rolling up&nbsp;their sleeves and getting stuck right into BFC early on.&nbsp; This&nbsp;encouraged the rest of the team, subs included, to do likewise. &nbsp;Fine hard-working performances&nbsp;from Yusuke, Dan&nbsp;and Lenny helped Dave command the defence with typical ferocity and VOLUME&nbsp;(a new&nbsp;TML award, League's Loudest Swearer,&nbsp;should be created just to see who would come runner up to Dave).&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Despite Sala's&nbsp;spirited display&nbsp;they couldn't&nbsp;compete with BFC in terms&nbsp;ball&nbsp; possession&nbsp;and attacking creativity.&nbsp; In the first 30 mins&nbsp;John&nbsp;Day had a goal&nbsp; (correctly)&nbsp;disallowed for offside, Taka saw a rocket shot crash off the bar, and, amazingly, one of BFC's own players&nbsp;cleared a goal-bound Aranda freekick off the Sala goal line.&nbsp; Add to that&nbsp;several low drilled crosses which angled across Sala's 6 yrd box, albeit&nbsp;with no takers, and it was clear to see who held the attacking edge.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										At the other end&nbsp;Sala showed a lack of cohesion when attacking and they&nbsp;never really troubled the BFC keeper.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half, Toby and Sam looked isolated up front,&nbsp;Shige&nbsp;was&nbsp;often forced&nbsp;deep to collect the ball,&nbsp;Take looked dangerous, as usual, on the right, but&nbsp;his final ball never&nbsp;had the precision needed to unlock a solid BFC defence, Brookey played well but always seemed to be&nbsp;smothered by numerous players&nbsp;before creating anything, and Pete, Scotty and Guido&nbsp;weren't dynamic enough to combine a&nbsp;solid defensive display with an attacking threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a mention for new boy, Rob, who will carry on the proud name of Harlow at Sala.&nbsp; Expected to be an attacking threat in the future,&nbsp;he was too often called on to carry out defensive duties,&nbsp;like all of the Sala team.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With 30 mins gone, the breakthrough came after another period of sustained BFC pressure.&nbsp; Most of the Sala midfielders had been pushed back into the box helping out the defence, which left Aranda free and unmarked 20&nbsp;yards from goal.&nbsp; Given space and time, he drilled an unstoppable shot into the bottom corner.&nbsp; Importantly, Sala's heads didn't go down but 5 minutes later they were beaten again from an inswinging freekick.&nbsp; A BFC midfielder rose the highest and looped a header over Shun and into the net.&nbsp; 2-0 at halftime.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In the second half Pete was given a more offensive midfield roll, which resulted in a much better attacking display.&nbsp; Pete, Guido, Toby, Lenny&nbsp;and Stu all had shots which improved on Koji's lone effort in the first half.&nbsp; BFC looked happy to sit on their lead, and possibly to just get off the pitch with all their limbs and reproductive apparatus intact as Sala continued to resemble a pack of&nbsp;pitbulls chasing a little bunny.<br>
										<br>
										However, even though the second half was a more even contest, sadly for Sala, against a team of BFC's calibre you can't afford to make sloppy mistakes, and it was two of these that gifted BFC their 3rd and 4th goals, effectively ending the match.&nbsp; First, Dan didn't clear a through ball, allowing John Day to ghost in and slot into an empty net.&nbsp; Then, Shun fumbled a freekick and with the Sala defence looking around for a little bunny to massacre they failed to spot John Day, who reacted&nbsp;the quickest, and&nbsp;bundled the ball home from a yard.&nbsp; 4-0 BFC.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										So, another defeat for Sala this season and it's clear that there's still work to be done by all the players, especially with regard to attacking as a unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did improve&nbsp;in terms of passion, spirit, resolve, effort&nbsp;and defensive solidity.&nbsp; Perhaps Sala's current&nbsp;situation was summed up best by BFC's captain when he said after the game&nbsp;&quot;It won't be long before Sala's are back at the top.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										We all certianly hope so.<br>
