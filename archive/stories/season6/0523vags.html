									<p><b>Hodogaya Koen, Saturday, May 23rd</b><br>
										A masterclass in survival saw Barbarians defeat an over-populated Vags team at the luxurious Hodogaya Koen by a whopping 4-0.<br>
										<br>
										Vagabonds came with a rugby squad of 17 players, and credit to Ged, the time was divided equally so that everyone got a measly 54 minutes each (can&rsquo;t we go back to 90 minute matches like real football, TML?) by 3 players sharing 2 positions.<br>
										<br>
										Vags started brilliantly, somewhere between Brasil and Arsenal but just not as good. For most of the first period they pummeled a Barbarians team that rarely got out its own half.<br>
										<br>
										Phil and Nao were particularly sparky up front with great off-ball runs that pulled the opposition defence around. Simon was industrious as ever, Masa was solid and put some great passes through, Muzzy and Kev were linking really well on the right. Steve and Ged mopping up nicely at the back.<br>
										<br>
										Chances came and went. A trademark stickyfoot dribble by Paul ended up in a superb lay off to Simon as he burst into the box, but his well-struck shot hit the bar. Another great team move saw their keeper make a great save but palm it to the feet of Adrian whose poacher&rsquo;s instincts saw him in the right place at the right time. Upset about the idea of Villa losing to Newcastle, he was distracted and hit the post &#150; from 4 yards out. A sitter even for the veteran.<br>
										<br>
										Changes were made and we loosened the grip. The Barbarians gained in confidence and after a few signs that they could actually play football, they did, by scoring a great goal down our left. One of their players lofted a perfect pass over our defence and their winger raced through to beat the hitherto flawless Tony from a very tight angle.<br>
										<br>
										Another soon followed, a corner saw a solid header from one of their basketball players fly into the top corner<br>
										<br>
										It got worse when their other winger beat Wayne for pace and raced into the box before going down as Wayne chased him. From the sidelines it looked like a stone-wall penno but BFC players closer to the action said it was a dive. Nevertheless, with the last kick of the half, Vags went 3-0 down.<br>
										<br>
										A bollocking from Ged did nobody any favours but at least he was up for it. Most of us weren&rsquo;t and it showed second half when the Barbarians, fighting for Div 2 survival, won every tackle and loose ball through sheer determination.<br>
										<br>
										Complacency was our main enemy, to be honest. Many of us thought we were going to tonk them, given the squad and their position in the league. Our almost Arsenal-esque passing and movement first half saw us want to pass the ball into the net. I thought it was going be a stroll in the park personally and even at 3-0 thought we would easily outplay them second half.<br>
										<br>
										We had the chance to fight back soon enough. A long-distance effort from Kev was way to close to keeper but he spilled it into the advancing BFC attackers who somehow knocked it over from 3 yards. Another sitter and game over after that. You can&rsquo;t expect to win games repeatedly missing in the 6 yard box.<br>
										<br>
										We kept at them. More half-chances, Adrian doing really well (including a wicked figure of 8 turn), but they scored on the break after Doctor Phil lost possession while waving to his missus. The team camaraderie fell apart, most players hitting poor passes and losing possession again and again. The mercurial Wadsworth looked leaden, Steve G looked troubled, and Golden Graham just plain hungover.<br>
										<br>
										The resulting 4-0 scoreline was very generous, but 100% credit to the Barbarians who showed incredible spirit and energy to win. Best of luck staying up.<br>
										<br>
										For Vags, we have to look at the bigger picture. It was educational and raised a few questions on the some of the problems the team faces as a whole. We need to address how best to solve them and improve the team. Everybody had the same playing time which was really beneficial so that everybody got to see what is like sitting watching on the sidelines and can now understand the frustration that others feel week in week out.<br>
										<br>
										The inequality in playing time is something we need to sort out at an official team meeting.<br>
										<br>
										Other things for everyone to mull over: Why did we have so many players? Considering it takes up 5 hours of your weekend including travel time, is it really worth it for 54 minutes of football. Should we therefore introduce a time-share system where people volunteer to miss games in order to play a full game next time?<br>
										<br>
										Why is our best player stuck in defence when he could be much more useful in midfield? Lyndsey, Gary, Wayne could easily play central defence and free up Steve to do what he does best &#150; boss the midfield.<br>
										<br>
										Just because someone plays once when we are short should they then be given automatic inclusion for every game when all the regulars are available and then take up playing time for regulars. Do we need more players? Weren&rsquo;t we supposed to dip into the BFC team for players when we are short...<br>
										<br>
										All issues that players are talking about and need looking at, but let&rsquo;s do our talking on the pitch next week and get some silverware for the season. Next up, Sala. Go Vags<br>
