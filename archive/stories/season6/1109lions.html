									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 9th November</b><br>
										
										After the BFC game, Lions were looking forward to challenging the top guns in Div 1, and with 6 players who were core in the win over BFC missing due to exams (and 1 sending off), Lions hoped that their skillful young lads will do the job against the Swiss. <br>
										It was deemed to be a bad day for Lions when Zohair (Man of the Match against BFC and scorer), felt a hamstring strain during warm up. Captain, Gaafar Somi, who was badly under the weather, had to still start the game due to lack of options on the bench. <br>
										Zohair started the game, and despite not being able to sprint, he back-heeled a beauty, deceiving the chasing defenders and the keeper, to tee the ball 7 yards out for the on rushing Omar, who placed a wildly tame shot (probably a pass back!) to the bewildered keeper. <br>
										Gaafar Somi then had a scorching 25 yarder hit the wrong side of the netting. <br>
										The Swiss pressed and with a free-kick bouncing a yard in front of Orlando, a Swiss player ran in to head the ball home to the amazment of all (including Orlando, who did'nt see the Swiss player on his blind spot)....never-the-less, Lions should be asking where the marking was? <br>
										The second half saw Zohair pull up completely with the hamstring and having to come off. A few re shuffles were necessary, but Lion's had no attacking options, especially with players like Tatsuya having to play in an unorthodox right-back position in place of the injured Hideki. <br>
										Lions relied in midfield on the young lads who could turn any game around, but that was not to be the game! They did try hard, but dribbling past 3 players and trying to take shots as you are losing your balance, surely was'nt the best of options!..Lions coach was growing in frustration on the chances one after the other being carved up and then either shot wide or placed tamefully in the wondering Swiss keeper's hands! <br>
										The score line could've been much worse, since as Lions pressed for an equaliser, twice the Swiss strikers found themselves alone in at least a 7 yard radius, and less than 10 yards out, being played onside by &nbsp;a wandering Lion defender. Luckily though, the Swiss strikers put all their shots wide as a helpless Orlando was waiting to pick the ball out of the net! <br>
										Lions were so casual, it was unbelievable! <br>
										The players who missed out on the game will be back for the clash against Embassy, with the coach determined to show the soon-to-be-benched underperformers, how a Lion plays, where even a draw is not an option! <br>
										A loss, below par, and losing Zohair for a month or so....surely that's a day to be forgotten by Lions! <br>
										<br>
										Man of the Match: Left winger for Swiss - Don'nt know his name, but he worked very hard up and down the flank.<br>
