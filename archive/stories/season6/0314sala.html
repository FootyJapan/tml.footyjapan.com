									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Saturday 14th March</b><br>
										With another solid performance Sala took all three points in this titanic tussle, running out 3-2 winners after a spirited fightback by the Jets, and then running swiftly to the boozer to pound down some pints in celebration. Yata!<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										TML's one and only, the cute and cuddly pirate, Dave Mcallan, put in a man of the match performance banging in two crucial first half&nbsp;goals,&nbsp;which&nbsp;the Jets matched with their scrambled deflected opener and a swift&nbsp;equaliser early in the second half.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										However, it was TML's other lovechild, Pete Swinnerington Swinners Swinney who had the last laugh when he finished a flowing move with the clamness of a zen monk, to bag all three points for Sala at the death.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										A close runner-up for man of the match was Brookey who supplied all three assists for Sala's goals, and even supplied a genuine 500 Yen coin in the post match footy sweepstake.&nbsp; Remarkable.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Apart from that everyone put in a good shift, with Sala creating loads of chances, and playing a lot of good football, but most importantly, when the match was tied and it was time to get down to business,&nbsp;Sala showed character and drive in scoring the winner.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As for the Jets, they counterattacked well and showed a lot of fight, which should keep them up this season, but in the end they conceded too much possession and territory, and relied too much on the heroics of their keeper.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Gomen to all and sundry for the tardiness and brevity of this report&nbsp;but a marathon has been run and much nonsense has been&nbsp;nonsensed by this&nbsp;shambolic and leg weary reporter, so it's time to say an early farewell.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in a bid to quench&nbsp;your thirst for engrossing footy&nbsp;stories&nbsp;I feel obliged to provide you with a last nugget of interest.&nbsp; <br>
										<br>
										Piff paff poof:&nbsp;<b><a class="txlink" href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=628629&sec=world&cc=4716" target="_blank">Iraqi player shot dead on tying goal attempt</a></b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Holy moly.&nbsp; I know it's a shocker but it's true.&nbsp; Search for it on the net at your peril, but let's all be thankful this sort of thing never happens in TML. Sleep tight, footy fans!<br>
