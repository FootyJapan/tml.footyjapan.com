									<p><b>Fuchu no Mori, Saturday 13 September<br>
										</b>It was with trepidation that the Dutch Embassy prepared their debut for the 08/09 season facing the Jetro team, always a solid competitor in the past.&nbsp; Captain Toshi assembled a squad made mostly of old faces with the artificial augmentation of a couple of players rumored to be of Heisei Umare. Whether the desire to look able in front of such youth charged the older Dutch players we will never know as Jetro did us a big favor by showing up with just eight players. Their team put up a good fight but the sub saharian sun mercilessly shining on Fuchu`s dunes and our heads certainly didn`t help their cause, and the game finished 6-0 for the Dutch, highlights being So and Matthaeus` goals. Dutch courage indeed, and a more realistic trial for the team likely to be the next game..<br>
