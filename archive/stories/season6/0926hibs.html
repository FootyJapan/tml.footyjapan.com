									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 26th September</b><br>
										The Hibs have had the better of the Geckoes over the past few seasons, compiling over twenty goals in the last four meetings, but we&rsquo;d heard rumours of their renewed squad including a tall kiwi midfielder and a few speedy and skilful Japanese. We&rsquo;d also noted their draw against the YCAC and win over the Swiss; so the Hibs went into this match expecting a tough and close game. A strong wind blew along Hachioji and the Geckoes won the toss and went with the wind. The Hibs kicked off and 11.4 seconds and 5 passes and a shot later the Hibs were one-nil up. Ike laying down the line to Yama who flicked it to the onrushing Tomo who laid a perfectly weighted pass to Andre, who rounded the keeper, got his head up but sees three Geckoes defenders between him and the net and coolly picks his line through them and struck it high and&nbsp;in from a tight angle.&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With some recent farcical decisions in the Premier League, there have (finally) been some more calls for video referees to be introduced. Meanwhile the TML has been looking at another controversial&nbsp;proposal which will see linesman fitted with electrodes on each nipple and delivered an electric shot by the referee each time they award blatantly incorrect decision to their own team. TML hierarchy are keen on the initiative but concern exists that in games such as this one the Saitama Hospital burns unit may become overloaded. There is also apprehension that some may decide the shocks to their liking and it will only exacerbate the problem. In this case Pietro decided that as soon as a Geckoes flag went up (which it repeatedly did) the call must be correct and the whistle went -&nbsp;no shocks or further thought required.&nbsp; It is tough for TML refs and you can understand them not wanting to deal with rougue &quot;assistants&quot;.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Geckoes were stung into action and then had the best of the next ten minutes with Hitoshi making a few key interventions to maintain the Hibs&rsquo; lead. In one incident the Gekoes received a free kick from twenty yards, the attacker, flicked the bird at the wall, then lofted the ball over the wall before Hitoshi flicked it over the post. All square and another&nbsp;top save from the big man. Andre won a free kick 30m out on the left and Mike McGirr delicately drifted one in at ankle height near post and Yama flicked it on the volley first time skidding into the net on the near post giving the keeper no chance.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Geckoes continued to press and were rewarded when a through ball into the Hibs box saw Jay nip in and win the ball just ahead of the Geckoes attacker, flicking clear from danger but into Josh and out for a corner. Somehow Pietro saw a penalty in this as the Geckoes attacker cannoned into Jay and Josh after the&nbsp;ball was cleared. Nevertheless the Geckoes were probably worth a goal at that stage and they finished the PK well. 2-1 and for a minute they were back in the game.<br>
										The Hibs hit back soon after through a great cross from McGirr and a typical Yama header. Funny that probably the shortest player in the league would be its best header of the ball. Yama was having a great first half leading some wags to comment that he should bring a new girlfriend to a game every week. 3-1 into half time and there still seemed to be goals in the game.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half was almost all one-way traffic as the Hibs piled forward with greater speed and numbers and the Geckoes struggled to cope. On one such occasion Josh got forward into the Geckoes box, knocking the ball past a defender and was fouled just as the ball was to trickle over the by-line.&nbsp; Andre dispatched the PK without fuss.<br>
										A cranky Australian Hibs midfielder was nutmegged and taunted by a speedy Geckoes full back and for some reason he saw the need to kick the poor blighter up in the air on the next play -&nbsp; &ldquo;The ball was there (I think)&rdquo; which saw a spate of handbags ensue that Pietro did well to keep a lid on.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Hibs then began the really turn it on with Mike turning two players in the box and finishing with a well placed low shot and then lofting the keeper from 25 yards. Tomo should have had a couple also - denied by the linesman's dilligence to their task. Andre hit the&nbsp;bar twice and new Hibs recruit Tani smacked the post with a 30 yard shot. Mike McGirr should have had a hat-trick as he got to a waist high bouncing through-ball before the keeper, rounded him but was called back for high feet...<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The Hibs are now up against the YCAC in what has become an early season table topping clash. Should be a good one.<br>

									<p class="white"><b>HACHIOJI PARK WARNING!!!</b></p>
									<p class="white">It is your responsibility to make sure that you and your players clear up after your game regardless of whether you're the first team on or the last. If there's one PET bottle or can left on the field after TML has finished using the ground we'll be PERMANENTLY BLACKLISTED - we've been told so.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And that's just the field... We've found out that the changing room is NOT in fact a changing room - it's a COMMUNAL area. Last weekend there were young girl teams playing on the sub-field and using the COMMUNAL area. We received a MONUMENTAL complaint about players getting changed in the communal area and outside near the pitches. From now on when girls or children are playing, TML players are to change in the SHOWER area, there is to be no undressing in the COMMUNAL area - as bizarre as this may sound and players MAY NOT get changed outside the COMMUNAL area or pitch-side.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As for the showers, do not leave empty shampoo or shower bottles in the shower - this is a disgrace.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Captains and players: we have one last chance chance. Just one. One PET bottle, one shampoo bottle... And that's it, NO MORE HACHIOJI. Seriously. From now on the last teams of the day MUST CHECK with the office before they leave that everything is in order. IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AT EVERY GAME WE'RE OUT. No more Hachioji, no more astroturf.<br>
