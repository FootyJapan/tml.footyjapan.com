									<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 3rd May</b><br>
										With the first round game finishing 1-0 to Lions, BFC were eager to pull one over the ex-Div 2 champs....and with Lions still unable to field their first choice string.....they still had a strong 16, including the infamous Orlando Torres, but this time not between the posts, but upfront....Fernando Torres?!<br>
										Lions had debutant Ernesto Riveira in goal, and Orlando partnered Ahmed Zahrani, with Bashaar, one of the most talented, yet unfit ex-Saudi U21 International playing behind the front 2.<br>
										The game started brightly for Lions, and with 15 minutes gone, Ahmed laid across a perfect ball, 7 yards out for Orlando, but his powerful shot sliced the ball and went agonisingly wide! What a debut it would've been for Torres to score against the team he helped to the Div 1 title last year as a keeper!<br>
										Bashaar's movement was limited but his trickery was top notch and as he won a freekick about 30 yards out....his quick thinking paid off as his quick pass to Orlando saw the blocked shot fall to AbuBakr on the edge of the box....and the young lad unleashed a fierce low shot into the bottom right of the goal to make it 1-0 to Lions with 25 minutes gone.<br>
										BFC were threatening on the left wing with Tatsuya playing for Lions in an unorthodox right-back position....but his pace bailed his positioning out, and he kept BFC's left attack at bay.<br>
										A couple of passes from BFC saw them put the ball in the net, but it was clearly offside and acknowledged by the referee.<br>
										Less than 5 minutes later, a long shot was dropped by Ernesto onto Evans' feet, and with him being clearly offside, the referee acknowledged the linesman and ruled the ball as offside. However, BFC surrounded the referee, and to the amazement of Lions and the supporters, the referee picked up the ball and walked to the centre, and as Lions thought the half was over, the referee said he changed his mind and awarded the goal!<br>
										1-1 at halftime.<br>
										Lions were very upset, but agreed to let our football, not arguments, to show BFC that on any day, with determination, no one can beat Lions!<br>
										At halftime, Acai and Fisal came on for Orlando and Bashaar, and Tatsuya made way for Khaleel.<br>
										Fahad, AbuBakr and Charles, kept cancelling all BFC's buildup, and counter-attacks saw Abu and Ahmed shoot wide, before Charles' great 35 yarder skimmed the far post. Shortly BFC had a shot hit the post, but any cross in the box was met by flying headers from Lions, and in the last 25 minutes, Orlando was re-introduced as a keeper, despite safe hands from Ernesto.<br>
										Orlando made a brilliant save shortly, as a 12-yarder fierce shot was held in style by the great keeper.<br>
										BFC's wing play was halted and thrown back as quick counter-attacks by AbuBakr and Khaleel, who made this game so fast and great to watch.<br>
										Carlos' trickery worked for a milli-second, but was always disarmed by Abu or Charles.....and you can see the frustration on BFC players as almost any shot attempt was blocked and countered!<br>
										Jon Day was strangely quiet, possibly due to injury after an early on challenge by Evis, where a perfect tackle turned into a late one and a booking to Evis due to quick feet by Jon.<br>
										Evans tried hard too, but the quick Kenyan must've been surprised at the pace Lions have now.<br>
										Evis, Sima, and Mo Birkia were flawless in defence, and Ahmed Zahrani worked very hard for the whole 80 minutes, looking dangerous with every effort he had.<br>
										<br>
										4 points off last year's Div 1 Champs was much welcomed during a roller-coaster season for Lions. Had top strikers ...Ken Hersche &amp; Zuhair Sule, and the dynamos Omar, Hideki and Captain Somi been available....BFC could&rsquo;ve had a night to forget!<br>
										<br>
										Brilliant play by Lions, but my man of the match, despite playing only 1 half, has to be one of the best performances you can see from a right-back.<br>
										<b>Man of the Match: Khaleel Alismaeel</b><br>
