									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday, May 24th</b><br>
										In terms of positions in the league table this game had little meaning.&nbsp; However, in terms of pride and history there was everything to play for.&nbsp; Attempting to beat Hibs for the first time in a league game, Sala pushed a little harder in the last&nbsp;20 minutes, found their match winner,&nbsp;and fought their way to a deserved 1-0 victory over last year's champions.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game&nbsp;began&nbsp;with both teams going for the jugular.&nbsp; Mike McGirr started a flowing Hibs move then almost finished it.&nbsp; Having peeled off his marker&nbsp;he placed&nbsp;a nice cut back from Naoki wide of the post.&nbsp; Rob Harlow then came close at the other end, drilling a low shot wide of the Hibs goal after cutting in from the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sustained pressure followed from Hibs.&nbsp; They hit the post from a corner and had a shot cleared off the line from a set piece move.&nbsp; With so much pressure being applied Sala needed some strong defenders at the back, and luckily for them, they had them.&nbsp; DC Dave Callaghan, Ian Jelley and&nbsp;Paul Clarke all showed the necessary grit and composure to keep Sala's defence tight enough to survive.&nbsp; And with the Sala strikers and midfielders&nbsp;putting in an energetic defensive shift, too,&nbsp;Sala's defensive trio couldn't complain of a lack of support.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With halftime beckoning, Sala hit back from a quick throw-in.&nbsp; Right winger, Take threw the ball to Scotty who nodded it down the line to the ever-alert, Rob.&nbsp; He&nbsp;drove into the box and sucked in 3 defenders before slipping a perfect square ball back to Scotty.&nbsp; But with the goal at his mercy he squeezed his half-volley just wide of the upright from the edge of the box.&nbsp; Despite not breaking the deadlock, this chance gave Sala belief as they had worked the opportunity from open play, whereas most of the Hibs chances were coming from set plays,&nbsp;and it was clear from then onwards that&nbsp;Sala could win this game.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>0 - 0 Halftime</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half was similar to the first with&nbsp;better attacking play from both teams, more chances at both ends and&nbsp;more saves from both goalkeepers.&nbsp; <br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Hibs again threatened mostly from free kicks and corners.&nbsp; One effort crashed off the Sala upright, another was tipped over by Sala keeper, Tomo, and yet another flashed agonisingly wide for the men in green, after they had cut the Sala defence open for only the second time from open play.&nbsp; At the other end, though Sala were threatening regularly, too, and it was Hitoshi who miraculously kept the sides even with 15 minutes to go.&nbsp; First he saved a left foot drive from Scotty. Then he produced his best save of the match from the resultant corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shige whipped in a great&nbsp;ball which Dave met with a blistering strike only for Hitoshi to save from point-blank range showing astounding reflexes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As the clock ticked down, both teams continued to push for a winner.&nbsp; But it was Sala who showed more hunger with attacking players like Sam, Shige, Ryotaro and Stu exemplifying Sala's fighting attitude, getting stuck in and battling like hell to push Sala on to victory.&nbsp; The fact that these players were working as&nbsp;hard as Sala's midfield soldiers, Pete, Scotty and Guido&nbsp;said a lot about Sala's team spirit, and it was this, as well as the goal that was soon to come, which proved the difference between these two teams.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										With 5 minutes left on the clock, taking the plaudits, once again, for&nbsp;scoring another&nbsp;vital goal was Sala's striking revelation, Rob 'Jnr' Harlow.&nbsp; With a 20 yard toe-poke he took the almost unbeatable, Hitoshi by suprise at his near post.&nbsp; Using a very under-rated shot, which every striker should have in his arsenal, Rob arrowed the ball into the bottom corner after the Hibs defence had backed off him.&nbsp; Predictably, Sala went absolutley bonkers in their celebrations.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And, even more predictably,&nbsp;they then went completely crackers in trying to close out the game with the whole team running about like headless chickes as each and every player turned into a berserker defender.&nbsp; Hibs tried to&nbsp;claw a goal back but with time against them Sala saw out the remainder of the game to claim their long-awaited first league victory over Hibs.<br>
