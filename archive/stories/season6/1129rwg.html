									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 29th November</b><br>
										Following a mid-week take-over from Robert Walters and the promise of a fresh new strip the geckoes took on the might of Saitama that is the Jets at Hachioji Park.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game kicked off at hectic pace with both teams putting themselves about, the jets more so than the Geckoes. Once the game settled down the Geckoes managed to take control and started to create a number of chances. To their credit the Jets defence held strong and thwarted a few strong runs from Masa and Kai in midfield. Andy Gill had a good chance to put the Geckoes 1 up but he hit the cross bar with the goal at his mercy.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The jets were not without their chances as they hit the cross bar from a lively strike from the edge of the 18 yard box. A jinking run from Kousuke was the catalyst for the first goal of the game. He danced round a couple of defenders and was finally bought down in the box, a no brainer for the ref. Jon stepped up and put the spot kick away. The score remained 1-0 for the remainder of the half.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half continued in similar fashion to the first and Kaz slotted a very tidy left foot volley from the end of the 18 yard box to make it 2-0. The introduction of a strong, quick striker (sorry no idea of name) by the jets gave the Geckoes defence a few headaches and at one stage he went through on goal but Goro expertly forced him wide and he ran out of room in the end. The 3rd goal for the Geckoes again came from the penalty spot. This time the ref awarded a jets player had handled in the box from an Andy Gill cross (not sure the ref had the best view but he awarded it anyway). Jon again took the pen and although the keeper saved onto the crossbar Jon finished off the rebound. The fourth goal again came from Jon as he got in the way of a Kai shot and claimed his first and last Geckoes hatrick.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The last goal was definitely the best; a short free kick on the edge of the area from Kai was smashed left footed into the top corner of the goal by Kazunori &ldquo;Keith Flange&rdquo; Kikuchi.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										During all this the following happened:<br>
										Brommy had a little fight with Tom and then ran around angry for a while<br>
										The Jets goalie was sent off for deliberate handball<br>
										Pete got upset about the players swearing around young kids and we laughed at him and continued swearing<br>
										The Jets captain got sent off for voicing his opinions<br>
										Jon played his last game for the Geckoes<br>
										Yu spoke for the first time in 1.5 years<br>
