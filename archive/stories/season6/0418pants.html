									<p><b>Nagahama, Saturday 11th April</b><br>
										Our illustrious leader Romen Benitez goes to extraordinary lengths for his team. Some call him mad, we call him dedicated! Still he managed to hire a mini bus for the team outing to the Marino&rsquo;s training ground. I call that dedication (madness), either that or the level of paranoia over team attendance is way too high!<br>
										<br>
										The pitch was beautiful, luscious, green grass that is soft and springy under aging knees (mine and Kev&rsquo;s). Romen decided that a demonstration of team unity was needed, we then did something new, a real warm up! Running, side steps, the works! After all that we were knackered and still had the game to play.<br>
										<br>
										After playing El Diego at the beginning of the season and seeing some of their score lines we started off a little warily but desperately wanting the win. We began in earnest with the old adage, the best defense is attack. Attack we did, the first 20 minutes was ours interspersed by terrifyingly fast Diego counters. We kept our shape and fought off the majority of the attacks well and Dan had very little to do.<br>
										<br>
										The Diego&rsquo;s passed the ball sweetly around the pitch much like a conductor with his orchestra, even being the opposition on the pitch I could appreciate the skill shown by their players. Still I wasn&rsquo;t there to gawp and got stuck in, a nicely placed challenge by myself poked the ball to Romen who with a sharp eye passed a through ball to Shotaro. He received the ball and opened the score line for the Panthers, 1-0, I dare not believe it.<br>
										Relief flooded the team, still 1-0 wasn&rsquo;t enough and we needed more. The second goal was truly a Tom Thurman classic down for goal of the season if not on Match of the Day, at least for the Panthers! Receiving the ball on the left with loads of time, Tom calmly lobbed the ball over the keeper, doing a good impersonation of stuck in the mud, into the very top right of the goal, 2-0. We rejoiced again but as I looked around the celebrating team I could see the seeds of doubt. Our last game against this accomplished team led to a 5-2 loss, after a 2-0 start we were determined not to lose this lead again!<br>
										<br>
										El Diego didn&rsquo;t want us to get too far ahead in the first half and seemed to notch it up a gear which knocked us back a bit. Dropping off the back three needed help and Romen and Rick pitched in from midfield to give us a hand. Kev, still not quite awake from a sleepless night, seemed to move around like Mr Soft at one point near half time which got him a bollocking from the gaffa, now now lads! Another fast paced break away left us on the back foot again but we held on and cleared the ball to the half way line. Kei, just having subbed in for Kev got hold of the ball and decided that Dan hadn&rsquo;t been busy enough in goal and gave him a nice back pass lob to deal with, Dan to his credit got the ball and punted it away, sadly to a sharp striker in the middle who took advantage of Dan being off his line and slipping on the dewy grass (yes it was that early!). Sadly, I am sure my poor ball control and throw in didn&rsquo;t help ease the fragile nerves as <b>we closed out the first half at 2-1</b>.<br>
										<br>
										Romen gave us a solid team talk during the break and it settled the nerves a little and gave the team new determination to come out and give it all. We had been giving El Diego a little too much space and it let them put the ball around pretty much as they felt like. Shutting them down quick seemed like the only option and our team battled like they were going down, not up! Very ball was contested and we gave them no time, this physical pressure seemed to throw them off kilter a bit and gave us some solid opportunities on goal. Rick began the aerial barrage with his monster throw ins determined this week was going to be the game for a Delap goal! He nearly managed it a couple of times with a nice header from Tom being bounced over the goal by the Diego defense. <br>
										<br>
										The game began to take a turn for the worse as the Panthers continued to question the referees&rsquo;s decisions, eyesight, the score line and as his knowledge of the game (All of which was done in the most respectful and polite manner as in all TML matches!). It reached dangerous levels as our level headed Captain remonstrated rather pointedly regarding a clear penalty decision involving a hand ball in the box. Breath was held as he Referee continued to give the evils to Romen, thankfully all calmed down and we carried on playing the beautiful game, 11 men intact!<br>
										<br>
										Talking of beautiful, a sublime cross from Kei found Ma in the middle, a delicate touch chested the ball into the path of a swiftly moving foot to volley the ball straight towards goal, the keeper moving with Flash like speed and agility tipped the ball over the goal just as the Panthers cheers began. Panthers carried on the domination with a lovely play started by Saco at left back. Saco switched the ball across the pitch to Kev who despite being tackled by three Diegos managed to pass the ball to Ma in the centre, the ball is a blur as he dummies with his right foot, knocks it cleanly into the path of his left with a hard and low ball flying past a dumbstruck El Diego keeper, 3-1, that feels a little more comfortable. Ma deserved the credit for an awesome goal but then decided to switch to the other team temporarily as he cleared another attempt over the goal from a yard out, we&rsquo;ll forgive him though. El Diego started to look as they were passing to shadows as we kept the pressure up tackling and generally getting in the way.<br>
										<br>
										Making sure we kept the pressure up Ma was chasing everything including a back pass that ended up being another goal for the panthers as he chipped it cheekily passed the mightily annoyed Diego keeper!<br>
										<br>
										If any goal was to define our season it was the fifth and final. It began from a goal kick &#150; Dan Clark passed it out to Saco at left back &#150; he hit a low pass into Rick about 10 yards inside our own half. As Rick turned 2 Diego midfielders came fast at him, they were desperately chasing the game at this point. <br>
										<br>
										<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/0411pants5.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="107" align="left" border="0">Romen made a run forward, one of the few times in the game, and Rick slid a great pass in between the 2 players taking them out of the game. Romen ran about 10 yards into the Diego half and hit a great through ball behind the Diego right back to the Russian who was charging down the touchline. Mikhail is up there as one of the most improved players this season and showed it again as he hit a great first time cross. The dream team goal was complete as Tom Thurman darted to the near post and flicked a downward header into the right corner. 5-1 and and unthinkable scoreline.<br>
										<br>
										El Diego weren&rsquo;t out of it and as I came back on we seemed to stop scoring and started to defend a little more, mm, not sure what that means. But with this lead we battened down the hatches and rode the brief storm until the end of the match, never have I been so relived to hear those three shrill whistles! 2 games left and promotion to play for!!<br>
