									<p><b>YCAC, Saturday, April 18th</b><br>
										For a team containing several players whose careers began before floodlights were invented, six o'clock on a Saturday night is a time to be in the bar talking bollocks about football, not out on the pitch playing bollocks at it. Nevertheless the Albion Old Boys managed to overcome this unwelcome disruption to their circadian rhythms and emerged from a hard battle against YCAC 2nds&nbsp;with a reasonably creditable 1-1 draw.<br>
										<br>
										Now as many of you already know, our TML ringmaster Sid Lloyd has such a passion for synthetic materials that he's on a one-man mission to try on every team shirt in the league. Well he's finally managed to get the 100% polyester Royal Blue Stanno Valencia of the Albion Old Boys rubbing against his nipples, and the excitement was plain to see in an impressively energetic first half display of forward play highlighted by the assist for the opening goal of the game, Sid winning the header from a long ball out of defence and nodding it right into the path of the onrushing Cyrille Segalini, who cut through the YCAC defence like&nbsp;un couteau &agrave; travers le beurre&nbsp;before slotting the ball home.&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										And talking of shirts, Sir Alex Ferguson once famously ordered his team to change their uniform at half time, jettisoning the &quot;silver&quot; shirts whose drabness he blamed for the players inability to find each other with their passes during a horrible first half drubbing by Southampton. Well the YCAC boys must have been eating their carrots recently, because despite the somewhat low wattage of the YCAC lights (a sop to the local residents?) and a kit so grey that the US military might consider using it to avoid radar detection, the home team were moving the ball around well, and despite the loss of the opening goal they had marginally the better of the first half possession. It was the Old Boys who had the better of the chances though, passing up two gilt-edged opportunities to stretch their lead. YCAC's only notable chance came when a powerful shot from their striker Phil (Denham?) was palmed acrobatically away by Albion custodian Nobu Kouka.<br>
										<br>
										Early in the second half the Old Boys spurned another opportunity to enter the comfort zone with a Mick O'Hagan header sailing just over the bar when it ought to have have sailed under. And needless to say the missed opportunities turned out to be costly as a lapse of concentration let YCAC back into the game. Kouka called for the cross but was only halfway there when it reached the head of YCAC striker Andy Chambers, who cooly lobbed his header back over the keeper and into the net. &nbsp;Both sides pushed hard for the winner, but with two very evenly matched teams a draw was probably the right result in an enjoyable and well-contested game. And so with leg muscles groaning from over-use and right-arm muscles moaning from under-use, at 7.30 it was straight into the bar to make up for lost time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
