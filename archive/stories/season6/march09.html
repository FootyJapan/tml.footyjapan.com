					<p><b>Misato, Saturday 28th March</b><br>
						The thought of getting up on a Sunday morning after a night drinking under the sakura to catch an early train out to the windy, dusty pitch that is Misato must have filled the team with dread! I however did all those things except the train and I have to say a car is the way to go! Still we all got there in some kind of condition, some hungover (naming no names), some with digestive issues (not sure Asahi pay the cleaners enough to go near that toilet again) and some in the peak of health, well, peak of health maybe a little extravagant. Still, we had a full team AND two subs, almost unbelievable.<br>

					<p><b>Todoroki, Saturday 28th March</b><br>
						Two late goals, one for each side, rounded off an entertaining game in the trite conditions of Todoroki. A scrambled goal five minutes from time, looked to have given the Lions the points, but a trademark Takanori screamer gave BEFC a deserved share of the spoils.<br>
						<br>
						Earlier in the week, it had looked like the Embassy were struggling to put together a team, let alone one to defeat a competitive Lions side that has enjoyed an impressive debut season in Division One. But a late rally of interest saw the Embassy assemble a team with a solid look throughout, and so it would prove as they settled well, despite safe-hands Eddie leaving clean-sheets Richie between the sticks for the first ten minutes. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0328befc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 22nd March<br>
						</b>Sala vs Swiss, an original TML/IFFL fixture that is best described, perhaps, against a backdrop of relevant statistics from campaigns past and present. And a few irrelevant ones as well.<br>
						<br>
						To the numbers then. The Swiss turned up on a windy Sunday evening with the bare 11. Sala, on the other hand, had a full 16 once again and welcomed back Toby, Yusuke, Take, and Koji, but they were also without several of their own regulars &#150; Brookey was back in Norwich, doing what it is that people do in Norwich, while Scotty and Sam followed Andy Cross&rsquo; lead in the Tokyo Marathon. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0322sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Stepping out of the van door at Misato you could have been thinking we had just stepped out of a plane 15,000 ft off the ground to go skydiving. It was pretty windy and cold, and like the goal nets too we wanted to fly away and never return, especially as we realized we had only six players. RWC had more that enough players taking up a full squad and both linesmen and more to spare. They had also brought out a couple of Geckoes as well. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0322mar.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						The grizzled veterans of The Albion Old Boys are almost perversely proud of their ability to give opponents a good mugging while nicking a narrow win, so to label them Free-Flowing Entertainers might be a bit like complimenting Mel Gibson's Braveheart on his cute tartan skirt.<br>
						<br>
						But the Old Boys may have to get used to the label as a 6-1 win over Barbarians made it 17 goals scored in the last 3 games, and moved the Albion into second place in TML Division 2. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0307aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
