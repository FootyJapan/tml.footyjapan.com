						Rain, rain, more rain. That&rsquo;s what I expected going out on Saturday morning to setagaya-koen&rsquo;s beautiful pitch. Low and behold I was greater with a recent stranger to Tokyo, SUN!

						Fill a bag with poo and punch it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like last year, that's the only way to describe&nbsp;another explosive encounter between Sala and France.&nbsp; So explosive, in fact, that&nbsp;Napolean and Nelson would have, respectively, found their diminutive stature and lack of&nbsp;appendages&nbsp;too inadequate to take part in this tumultuous battle. And, what a stonking score to go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;7-1 to the Sala,&nbsp;with two players bagging hatricks, no less than 5 yellow cards!! <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0222sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Even though it involved a team that specializes in against-the-odds victories, this game would have had William Hill and Paddy Power scratching each other's heads in disbelief. Mauritzio had a 14-man squad that looked much more capable than their lowly league position would suggest. The Albion Old Boys played almost the whole game with ten men, three of whom would have been substituted for injuries had the option been available. Nevertheless it was the limping veterans who were on the right end of a 7-3 scoreline that takes them firmly into nosebleed territory at the top end of Division 2. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0221aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						A roller coaster season for Lions saw them field their strongest squad for the first time this season, despite the absence of the influential captain Somi for the third game in a row. With the bench holding the likes of Ahmed Gaafar, Omar, and last year&rsquo;s Lions top scorer Ken Hersche, surely the Geckoes were in for a match.<br>
						Lions should have won the first game against Geckoes, but lack of finishing made them pay dearly as Geckoes won the first meeting 3-1. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0221lions.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Back in September, the Dutch Embassy easily disposed of a good Zion team thanks to their swift strikers, but this time the Zion boys put a much better performance and showed significant skill with the ball. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0221defc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Talk about going against your best interests. Like George Best scratching the stitches above his freshly-transplanted liver with one hand while pouring himself a pint of vodka with the other, the Albion Old Boys just can't seem to keep their spirit bottled up, as even the knowledge that a victory would place them them firmly in the unwelcome territory of the Division Two promotion battle couldn't stop them from putting in another committed display to overcome the BFC Vagabonds with a hard-earned but well-deserved 4-2 win. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0214aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						With a collective age of around half a millennium, &nbsp;it's understandable that over the years the Albion Old Boys have picked up more than their share of bad footballing habits, some of which, like regularly bringing a chocolate-coloured toy poodle to watch you play, are far too embarrassing to even mention here (so Karl Twohig can rest assured that his secret is safe with us). <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0201aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

With an incredibly strong and cold wind blowing lengthways down the pitch from the club house end of the ground, the team with their backs to the wind were always going to find the going considerably easier. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0201rwc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
