						If only Sala could face FJ Plate opposition every week, and play on nice dry pitches,&nbsp;their current transitional phase would be a lot easier to&nbsp;come through.&nbsp; However, with a waterlogged pitch and a hungry Celts team eager to cement their place in the TML above Sala, there was to be no easy ride in this match. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0131sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<h1 class="red">Farewell Alex Sahara. If I was a girl....</h1>
					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday24th January</b><br>
						BFC said farewell to Alex Sahara whose final game for the club reflected all that the young dynamo is: cool, slick, forward thinking and very, very sexy. Alex has been at the club since he was 14 years old and this length of service actually grants him exclusive entrance to the OB's club, yet he's still, or was our youngest player. Arriving late for his final game, wearing a limited edition pair of Converse and a couple of Vivienne Westwood bags under his eyes form the night before, Sahara went about doing what he does best. Terrorising the opposition with his pace, hair band and metrosexual magic.... <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0124bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 25th January</b><br>
						Celts started their Sunday evening with a bit of a scare when midfield maestro Henry decided to leave the kit bag outside the Citibank building in Roppongi while he popped upstairs to withdraw his match subs &amp; pocket money for the night. On his return he found numerous police officers had surrounded the bag, cordoned off the immediate vicinity and were calling in the bomb&nbsp;squad to destroy the bag in a controlled explosion. Having negotiated his way out of the situation by basically picking up the bag and scarpering down the road with Tokyo&rsquo;s finest in pursuit (cue the Benny Hill music), he managed to find his way to the rest of the lads and we made our way to the game. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0125celts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						If the 6 am alarm clock and the 2-hour drive into darkest Saitama don't do it, if the stinging snow flurries and the express-delivery-from-Vladivostok winter wind don't do it, then the first slide tackle that sends several litres of ice-cold surface water through your shorts to give a rude awakening to your Nobby Stiles will definitely get you thinking &quot;What the fcuk am I doing here?&quot;. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0124aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						BEFC went into this fixture pointless and on the back of some recent demoralizing defeats. Up against a Lions side, who on the back of a creditable draw with the Hibs the previous week, were looking up rather than down, the (imaginary) bookmakers gave the Embassy little hope. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0118befc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						On a fresh January afternoon at Fukuda Denshi the Barbarians opened the scoring midway through the first half when a solid shot from outside the box found its way in to the Clash goal. <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/tml/archive/stories/season6/0119rwc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Pablo Pomares`s infant son has had trouble sleeping. Luckily for him his father knows from experience one place in Tokyo where the urge to sleep is overwhelming &#150; a Vagabonds match.
