									<p><b>ASIJ, Sunday 10th May</b><br>
										<br>
										The most heart-stopping moment of BFC's 2-0 win over the JETs was the baby Pomares wrapped in a blanket and almost getting stepped on by giants in football boots. <br>
										<br>
										<b>It's not as if he's a set of car keys now is it?</b><br>
										<br>
										If babies belong in prams, at least pitch-side, then so do one or two members of BFC, who won this game with two moments of genuine skill.<br>
										<br>
										Day continued his hot streak with a clinical finish after latching on to a fine ball from Aranda, breaking the tedium five minutes before half-time.<br>
										<br>
										Sakai brilliantly added a second from an acute angle 10 minutes into the second half, after which it was largely an exercise in persuading certain South American team mates to pass the ball.<br>
										<br>
										One touch football was the rally cry, as it always is. Eight, nine, 10 aaaaaand possession coughed up again was the pattern of a horrible final 20 minutes. Zero movement, very little thought, players blowing out of their shorts. No players should be exempt from a spell on the bench. Torres and Ronaldo were both hauled off early this weekend.<br>
										<br>
										At least the kit turned up, via Doyle and the ambassador of Djibouti. Having Doyle back was a delight and watching him frollick down the right like a lamb jolly good fun.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Salmon time</b><br>
										<br>
										Day rattled the bar with a powerful header but with little support in attack, balls not released quickly enough and little riding on the game except pride, the lack of urgency was palpable.<br>
										<br>
										Morson was forced to make a couple of tidy interceptions while 'Hotmum' (who has shot up a few inches since he was last seen) provided a safe pair of hands in goal in a welcome return.<br>
										<br>
										Woszildo and Imai linked well on the left but it was one of those games, the biggest highlight perhaps when the American School's headmaster came over and called Aranda into his office for a telling off.<br>
										<br>
										'Pass the ....ing ball!' he doubtless said, although the Paraguayan swore it was because of the blue language drifting under a gorgeous full moon to the neighbouring gardens and spoiling the Bolli and foie gras.<br>
										<br>
										BFC's predictability from free kicks (outside of shooting distance) also needs addressing, particularly from the right -- surely the left-footed inswinger carries more menace. Variety is ze spice of life, as the French say.<br>
										<br>
										It should be noted Sakai's follow-up goal sprouted from a superb Aranda free kick. From within 25 metres there is no one better in the TML at this art, but Imai's left foot is also a thing of culture and deserves a bit of an airing from time to time when BFC need to fizz stuff into the box from the right. 'Share the rock!' as LeBron James says.<br>
										<br>
										The JETs, meanwhile, did get the ball into the net, only to be pulled up for offside, ironic after last week's fun and games with the flag-happy linesmen, but if Doyle flags you offside, you are offside. No ifs or buts. He comes from Crouch End, not Peckham and would sooner commit seppuku than cheat, so whoever you were you WERE offside, that is GOSPEL.<br>
										<br>
										<b>'There's a baby on the floor!'</b><br>
										<br>
										It was 'Honest Brian' who raised the alarm about baby Pako, blissfully unaware as he dozed in his T-shirt of snake motifs of the potential danger he was in. Not yet walking but in amongst the flying studs, just like his papa.<br>
										<br>
										The nipper, however, had the good sense to slip into a deep snooze two minutes into the game. His grandparents chose not to renew their season tickets after last week's dog's dinner -- you can see where the ankle-biter gets his intelligence from. And that I am struggling here to write any sort of match report. Apologies to the TML.<br>
										<br>
										On another completely unrelated subject, Manchester City were a disgrace tonight. Hughes and Robinho should have their Jacobs hacked off with a blunt knife.<br>
