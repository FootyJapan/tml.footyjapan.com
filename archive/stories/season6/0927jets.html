									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 27th September</b><br>
										
										
										The Saitama Jets claimed their first points of the season, twice coming from behind, to record a vital win over a rugged and physical French side at Hachioji Park.<br>
										<br>
										The last time the sides met, in season 4, the Jets sent the French down to Division 2 in an ill-tempered game.  This meeting begun in similar fashion with some late challenges going unpunished by the referee and things threatened to boil over, however commonsense prevailed and the game developed into a tough but enjoyable affair littered with mistakes and the occasional piece of skill.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets were able to call on their strongest squad so far this season and started well holding the majority of the possession, passing the ball around and asking questions of an ageing French defence.  It was Les Blues (actually playing in white) who struck first though, against the run of play, when a shanked clearance allowed the fast and skillful Japanese forward to nip in front of the Jets&rsquo; defender and rocket a shot into the top corner from 15 yards.<br>
										<br>
										The Jets responded by continuing to press the French back and created a number of opportunities around the box, none of which could be converted, but it was actually the French who almost scored again.  A disputed free kick on the edge of the box was beautifully struck by Jorge &lsquo;The Ref&rsquo; (who was actually playing rather than reffing) and was heading for the top corner before Harada&rsquo;s gloved hand managed to push it onto the underside of the bar.  The big Mexican&rsquo;s cry of &ldquo;Get in you bitch!&rdquo; was insufficient to force the issue and the ball was hacked away from danger.  Such moments can turn a game and the French must have been cursing their luck, for with just a minute left on the clock Saitama won a corner and Sasaki&rsquo;s driven kick flummoxed the &lsquo;keeper who could only flap it into the net for 1 &#150; 1.  The Jets went in at half-time a tad fortunate to be level, but in truth it was deserved.<br>
										<br>
										The game opened up considerably in the second half with the Jets still enjoying the lion&rsquo;s share of the ball, but with the lively French attack constantly menacing the Saitama backline.  On one attack they won a corner which was flicked on at the near post and fell to a French head inside just three yards out.  It looked a certain goal but Harada&rsquo;s reactions were lightening and somehow he turned the goal-bound effort over the bar from point-blank range!  However it was another defensive error that allowed the same striker to put France 2 &#150; 1 up.  A through ball seemed to be covered by the centre-half, but Harada came rushing out to claim the ball and could only manage to take out his own defender and leave the forward with an almost open goal from 15 yards.  Incredibly, right-back Fancutt managed to get back and block the striker&rsquo;s first effort on the line but could do nothing about the follow-up.  2 &#150; 1 France, with 25 minutes left to play.<br>
										<br>
										The French all but disappeared as an attacking force fro the next 15 minutes as Saitama went searching for an equalizer and began cutting through the tiring rearguard, but too often the final ball was poor.  The French started giving away free kicks and it was from one of these that the Jets equalized for the second time through the combined efforts of three new signings.  Jun Koike&rsquo;s free kick found David Osei at the back post and his downward header back across goal was bundled over the line by fellow Ghanaian Sam Babs.  2 &#150; 2 and the French were rocking a little.  Their super striker continued to cause problems, but it was Saitama who looked more likely to score a winner and it duly came courtesy of another Koike free kick.  The ball was looped in and came down just in front of the goal line Yoshiba leapt and got something on the ball before the goalkeeper, who felt he was impeded, and the Jets led for the first time, 3 &#150; 2, with just minutes to go.<br>
										<br>
										Although still very early in the season it was a vital victory for the Jets who know that these are the games they must win in order to avoid spending another year floundering at the foot of the table.<br>

									<p class="white"><b>HACHIOJI PARK WARNING!!!</b></p>
									<p class="white">It is your responsibility to make sure that you and your players clear up after your game regardless of whether you're the first team on or the last. If there's one PET bottle or can left on the field after TML has finished using the ground we'll be PERMANENTLY BLACKLISTED - we've been told so.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And that's just the field... We've found out that the changing room is NOT in fact a changing room - it's a COMMUNAL area. Last weekend there were young girl teams playing on the sub-field and using the COMMUNAL area. We received a MONUMENTAL complaint about players getting changed in the communal area and outside near the pitches. From now on when girls or children are playing, TML players are to change in the SHOWER area, there is to be no undressing in the COMMUNAL area - as bizarre as this may sound and players MAY NOT get changed outside the COMMUNAL area or pitch-side.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										As for the showers, do not leave empty shampoo or shower bottles in the shower - this is a disgrace.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Captains and players: we have one last chance chance. Just one. One PET bottle, one shampoo bottle... And that's it, NO MORE HACHIOJI. Seriously. From now on the last teams of the day MUST CHECK with the office before they leave that everything is in order. IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AT EVERY GAME WE'RE OUT. No more Hachioji, no more astroturf.<br>
