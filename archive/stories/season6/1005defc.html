									<p><b>Todoroki, Sunday 5th October</b><br>
										The Dutch convened at the badlands of the Musashi Kosugi ground, optimistically renamed Todoroki by some joker, for a TML 2 classic with Zion. A late (6.30 PM) kickoff added to the bleakness of the location and to top it all off a nice early Winter rain graced the area just as we kicked off. <br>
										But enough whining and back to the game. After a first half where the two teams shared the initiative, the Dutch midfield took control of the game early in the second half with quick passes and managed to pierce the Zion defence twice in equal fashion, with&nbsp;the Oranje strikers taking advantage of holes in the other team`s offside trap and lobbing their keeper. <br>
										A thought goes to captain Toshi who had to go for a hospital check after a tackle that would have made Steve Taw proud. Three more points in the pocket for the Dutch, what`s not to like.<br>
