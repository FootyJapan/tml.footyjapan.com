									<p><b>Hanno, Saturday 11th October</b><br>
										Saturday&rsquo;s late game vs newly promoted Lions FC had an air of uncertainty lingering prior to kickoff. Coming into the game Lions had only played the sole game vs France and had emerged victorious. The JETs had started to play some improved football since losing their opening match quite handily to BFC, losing by one goal to Sala and then beating France. Would tonight be the first time in recent memory that the JETs could string together consecutive victories?<br>
										<br>
										The game started promisingly, as the Lions rearguard looked confused after playing a clear backpass to their keeper within the opening 2 minutes. Jets looked equally confused as newboys David and Sam &ldquo;conversed&rdquo; with multi-lingual Sasa in who knows what language, deciding who would take the free kick from 8 yards out. The confusion continued immediately prior to the kick being taken as Sasa looked bewildered realizing that he was laying the ball off to Sam instead of the other way around! Needless to say, the Lions stopped the free kick that immediately resulted in a corner (Missed chance #1).  Sasa took control again and floated a beautiful corner to the back post where center back Turner glided in for the  volley only to have the ball skim under his outstretched leg and bounce harmlessly away (Missed chance #2).  Unfortunately for the Lions, their all-star keeper Orlando was mysteriously injured on these two plays and they had to sub in the rather robust manager/player to fill in. Things were looking good for the JETs at this point.<br>
										<br>
										The rest of the first half saw the JETs dominate possession and create lots of good movement. Their midfield played quite well, with David, Rob, Ikko and Sasa linking well together.  Unfortunately, the final pass or shot was not of the same quality.  With the LIONS stand in keeper looking unsure of his positioning and the Jets looking likely to score, the countless corners and free kicks were surely going to produce something.  Needless to say, the loss of Orlando as LIONS keeper was never capitalized upon (missed chance #3).<br>
										<br>
										The second half saw JETs making some substitutions. Bringing on some of the JETs 2nd team players, Chris and Spencer played some good football after toiling away in the JETs 2nd team game played before this game.  David was tireless in his tracking down of passes and his trickery on the ball hasn&rsquo;t been seen since the likes of Ryan Botta or Jack Faircy.  Sam and Shimi worked hard up front but the goal that we worked hard to obtain, never did materialize.  Sasa had several good free kicks stopped by the keeper, and several JETs players missed golden chances.  Capitalizing on the chances are something the JETs definitely need to improve.  Lions played well and took more of the possession in the 2nd half.  A solid team to be sure, but the reaction after the final whistle spoke volumes.  While several Lions players let out cheers of elation after drawing a point from a match that started so grimly, the JETs shook their heads in dismay. Missed chances in a game that everybodys-favorite-ref Jorge summed up as &ldquo;JETs vs Lions, 0-0, nada nada, no reds, no yellows, why the f*** am I here?&rdquo;.<br>
