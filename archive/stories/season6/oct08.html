					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 26th October</b><br>
						Celts rocked up to their 4th game of the season having had a mix bag of results in the previous 3 games, beating Geckoes 2-1 then a 1-1 draw with BFC before succumbing to a 0-3 defeat to YCAC. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1026celts.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 26th October</b><br>
						3 weeks in a row we have made our way out to Misato and all we received was a poxy two points from the first two games. Not that we were grumbling mind, we were happy to take on the top team and come away with a draw and despite a hard fought game a draw against Sun Utd was a blessing. So, that brings us to this week&rsquo;s game. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1026pan.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hodogaya koen, Saturday 25th October</b><br>
						The Hibs have an unwritten rule that if we score 10 against a team we don&rsquo;t write a match report. Once it reaches that level, the scoreboard really says it all and reflecting on missed chances in the report adding something along the lines of &ldquo;it should have been 15&rdquo;; is not going to go down well. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1025hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Unfortunately, not the classic metal band of the 90s, fronted by long-haired rock god Sebastian Bach, but the place where Sala FC's season, thus far, has ended up. In a big pile of man poo would be another way to describe that place.<br>
						<br>
						Having started the season with an absolute gubbing at the hands of YCAC, Sala had scraped together two victories against Saitama Jets and BEFC, played out a dismally flat draw with Swiss Kickers, lost a few more guys to injury and irritated the TML with a scandalous lack of match reports!! What more could go wrong??? Defeat to those lovely lads, the Wall Street Geckoes?? Surely not. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1018sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 18th October</b><br>
						Last week was a brutal five nil battering of the embassy attaches, this week a merciless seven nil spanking of the Swiss Kickers.<br>
						Like Capello&rsquo;s England, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re clearly not the finished article.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want to fall for the old English sports writer&rsquo;s trap of hyping an average team after one or two results against mediocre sides like Kazakhstan, but it is quite thrilling to imagine what kind of performances BFC could be capable of when they really hit their stride. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1018bfc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						Every time we play at Misato I feel like I have to begin preparations to get there at least three days in advance, getting the route to the station, an ordnance survey map for the route from the station and a GPS just in case. Still most of the team arrived on time, sadly we started (and finished) the game with a man down, not the ideal way to face the team at the top of the division. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1019pan.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Saturday 18th October</b><br>
						In a sexy new kit that would have drawn admiring gasps from their female fans if such creatures existed, the Albion Old Boys were doing a very good impersonation of classy footballers both before and during Saturday's encounter with Division Two's other newly-promoted team. But the Old Boys came away from Misato with no points for either style or execution as FC International converted a late, late penalty to nick a 2-1 win with the very last kick of the game. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1018aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

						I think we&rsquo;ll just keep it simple here, shall we&#x2026;) The rescheduling of last weekend&rsquo;s match from the Saturday to the Monday unfortunately saw an already injury hit BEFC squad further robbed of regular first team players. This meant that about half of those who made it to ASIJ for the clash with BFC were making their season (and in several cases, team) debuts. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1013befc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

					<p><b>Misato, Sunday 12th October</b><br>
						A determined display of old-fashioned football on a hot Misato day saw the Panthers climb into the Top 5 jungle of Division 3. Overhead kicks from outside the box; crazy red cards; diving headers; double turns on antique sixpences; pitch invasions and streakers &#150; there was none of that in this mid-table scrap that ended honours even. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1012pan.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

A late (6.30 PM) kickoff added to the bleakness of the location and to top it all off a nice early Winter rain graced the area just as we kicked off. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/1005defc.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>
