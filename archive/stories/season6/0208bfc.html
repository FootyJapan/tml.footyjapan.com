									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 8th February</b><br>
										<br>
										Typical Aranda. One moment brilliant, the next caught in possession, often chuntering away to himself in Spanish at anyone who will listen and then -- BOOM!!! Receiving the ball 30 metres from goal, El Mullito pulls the trigger.<br>
										<br>
										'Gol, gol, gol, GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!' 1-0 and BFC are off and running.<br>
										<br>
										BFC clashes with Sala have always been fun. Noisy, but fun. This one had me reaching for the Meilax after 10 minutes. When did Harry Enfield join Sala? 'THAT'S RUBBIIIIIISH THAT IS!!! YOU DON'T WANNA DO THAAAAT! KICK ME WILL YA?! I'LL 'AVE YOU I WILL!' Brilliant!<br>
										<br>
										BFC had already been denied an opener when Day, nicely teed up by the Frogman Evans, curled one off (nice!!!) into the top corner only to be ruled offside. It must have been close. But the former skipper would poach two more later on anyway so ... know what I mean? ... kind of ... whatever, star.<br>
										<br>
										That disallowed effort came after Saco, who had been on the razzle until the wee hours, had smashed a right-foot shot against the bar from 25 metres.<br>
										<br>
										The big question of the night was looming large, however, as Dr. Lowes unhooked his colostomy bag and prepared to come on. Would BFC have to sacrifice two players? Or would a team of crack surgeons appear from behind the trees to perform the tricky, potentially life-threatening operation of separating Phil and his girlfriend?<br>
										<br>
										<b>Voodoo People<br>
										</b><br>
										The search for a four-sleeved shirt had proved fruitless, so on trotted the BFC's Siamese twin, looking quite forlorn, a bit like a squirrel who had misplaced his nuts. Or sumfink.<br>
										<br>
										But what was happening between BFC and Sala? Yes there were a few tasty tackles, Aranda going down as if shot by a sniper after Guido came into him from behind while Enfield and Sala's chatty number eight Scotty were in the mood for some. But there were fewer fisticuffs, stabbings or drive-by shootings than normal.<br>
										<br>
										Taka Imai, meanwhile, had vowed not to ping anything near-post for Himmer after coffee spillage in his motor on the way to the game and was true to his word, both players collapsing in giggles after the little fella deliberately whipped one over the striker's head to the linesman on the far side.<br>
										<br>
										Aranda's goal had settled BFC down, Evans, in full boiler suit and balaclava, producing some nice touches alongside Brummie Mike in midfield.<br>
										<br>
										Sala, back in business under Guido after a dodgy start to the season, will not have been happy about BFC's second, a floated free kick from Doyle into the 'mixer' and up pops Brummie's brown mop to flick the ball over the goalkeeper, his first goal for the team coming at a nice time just before the break.<br>
										<br>
										It's not often you feel inclined to write 'Sala may have missed Sid Lloyd in goal.'<br>
										<br>Shameless mid-report promotion:<br>
										 <a class="txlink" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5181M020090209" target="_blank">http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5181M020090209</a><br>
										<br>
										<b>Baby's Got a Temper</b><br>
										<br>
										Halftime. A cup of tea would have been nice, especially for those on the sidelines frozen solid, and a soothing team talk, instead of half a dozen people chattering away like budgies, apparently unaware of the fact that it only takes one person to state the bleedin' obvious, and that person really ought to be the captain.<br>
										<br>
										Armed with nuggets of wisdom such as 'We must continue to work hard' and 'We must continue to be positive,' BFC went out and continued to work hard and be positive.<br>
										<br>
										Yamagishi began to cause problems for Sala, who themselves were limited to shots from distance, frequently opting for daisy-cutters against BFC's 'Action Man'-sized goalkeeper and Tepi showed a safe pair of hands to just about everything.<br>
										<br>
										Clarke, who appeared to have the hump about losing an online zombie-zapping game against some teenage nerd in deepest Venezuela at 4 a.m. that morning, perked up in the second half, although run of the day was Doyle's.<br>
										<br>
										Rolling back the years, the 'Engine' charged upfield, screaming 'Baaaaaagghghgghhhhhh!' like General Sir Anthony Cecil Hogmanay Melchett before flicking a right-foot pass, OUTSIDE OF THE BOOT (do not adjust your sets) which was just a touch too strong for Evans, even with his telescopic legs.<br>
										<br>
										<b>Diesel Power</b><br>
										<br>
										On the subject of the President of Djibouti: Is he simply Simon Bebbington sprayed brown? The resemblance is other-worldly. Those Inspector Gadget legs, the snake hips, the TACKLING, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! The Evans of old would light up a fag once he lost the ball and wait for it to come back across the halfway line.<br>
										<br>
										More goals came. Which was nice. Yamagishi swept in a ball from the right and, with Sala's defenders and keeper slow to react, Day nipped in and walked the ball into the net, finishing off with that favourite 'leaping salmon' move of his.<br>
										<br>
										There was more salmon. Aranda's free kick on the edge of the box spilled by Sala's goalie and there was Day again, snapping up the loose ball on the line and gleefully bundling it, himself, and anything else at hand into the back of the net.<br>
										<br>
										Sala, for all their industry, were well beaten on the day but will be a threat to the top teams when they hit their stride. Anything in or around the BFC area was dealt with as a personal insult by Morson, Doyle and Manson, who was rock solid on his welcome return.<br>
										<br>
										The TML needs strong a Sala and Swiss teams to prevent the top three forming a breakaway league -- a three-team Premier League where we just play headers-and-volleys with ourselves all year. (It's late, I'm tired, some of this stuff works, some doesn't. You don't have to read it! DO YOU WANT SOME?!)<br>
										<br>
										Um ... Little remained apart from some handbags (a few 'Come on then's!' and 'Get the .... away from me's!' from a couple of clowns I wouldn't name), quickly forgotten at the final whistle.<br>
										<br>
										Nine points off table-topping Hibernian then but BFC look to be coming into some sexy form, Sala look quite capable of playing spoilers in the title race this season and I have run out of things to say as 'Boston Legal' has just started.<br>
