									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 22nd February</b><br>
										Fill a bag with poo and punch it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like last year, that's the only way to describe&nbsp;another explosive encounter between Sala and France.&nbsp; So explosive, in fact, that&nbsp;Napolean and Nelson would have, respectively, found their diminutive stature and lack of&nbsp;appendages&nbsp;too inadequate to take part in this tumultuous battle. And, what a stonking score to go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;7-1 to the Sala,&nbsp;with two players bagging hatricks, no less than 5 yellow cards!!&nbsp;<br>
										<br>
										The match burst into life with young Rob Harlow&nbsp;smashing in a 20 minute hatrick in&nbsp;no less than well, 20 minutes<b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kazaam</b>!&nbsp; It was his first start as striker and&nbsp;feck me&nbsp;did he&nbsp;make&nbsp;a&nbsp;case for the best new striker&nbsp;in the world ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										First, he ran on to a nice pass from Brookey and slotted the ball low past the onrushing keeper.&nbsp; Next, he&nbsp;took a cushioned header from Pete on his chest and blasted a volley&nbsp;through a crowded box and over the keeper.&nbsp; <b>Kerrunch</b>!!&nbsp; For his hatrick, he&nbsp;collected a pass from &quot;I want more beauty&quot;&nbsp;Take and turned his&nbsp;defender at the same time, then danced round the keeper&nbsp;and slotted into an empty net.&nbsp; <b>Kerpow</b>!!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Thankfully, because I'm running out of&nbsp;onomatopoeias beginning with K to describe him, he stopped his scoring there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										In between Rob's strikes, Lenny hit the post and watched agonisingly as the ball rolled along the line and into the keeper's arms, and Pete, Scotty, Toby and Brookey all threatened with shots.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										This match was all&nbsp;Sala, and sure enough, Clarkey added a fourth with a trademark big baldy back post header from a deep Brookey corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Then, France's 11th player turned up.&nbsp; Aha, that's why the game was so&nbsp;one-sided!!!&nbsp; Well, no, would be the correct answer to that.&nbsp; Yes, he did make an impact, being France's best player on the day, and scoring a tremendous goal a few minutes before halftime (a stunning strike from a rodonculous angle), but as the second half was to show he didn't change the game.&nbsp; 11 vs 11, Sala were still far too good for the French.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										<b>4-1 Sala at half-time.</b><br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The second half brought another hatrick, the need for more&nbsp;words beginning with K, and a massive barny which embarrassed everyone,&nbsp;the French in particular.&nbsp; Oh, and Ian got in a left footed cross&nbsp;(he bribed me to include that - <b>kerching</b>!).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										This time, Sala's resident best striker in the world, Tobias Long, got the fabled 3 goal milestone.&nbsp; His first was a fine team goal with the ball moving swiftly through midfield, due to Pete's constant&nbsp;quick&nbsp;distribution,&nbsp;then&nbsp;into Rob's feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob layed it off to Toby inside the box.&nbsp; Toby's&nbsp;nimble footwork&nbsp;made space beautifully and his&nbsp;early shot gave the keeper no chance as it hit off the inside of the post and in.&nbsp; <b>Killer</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										His second came after another nice team move gave&nbsp;Ryo the chance to dribble past a few defenders&nbsp;and whack a&nbsp;dipping shot off the bar.&nbsp; Guido was there to collect&nbsp;the rebound.&nbsp; He unselfishly squared to Toby who finished calmly.&nbsp; <b>Kick-ass</b>.&nbsp; 6-1 to Sala.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Brookey supplied the cross for Toby's third, which was a nice header across the keeper and into the corner.&nbsp; <b>Kingly</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										It must be noted that Lenny, being the grand poobah off stats that he is, pointed out after the game that this was the first double hatrick ever for Sala.&nbsp; <b>Knowledgeable</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										And so, onto the fracas.&nbsp; By this point, the match had turned distinctly dirty with various squabbles and&nbsp;grudges brooding all over the pitch.&nbsp; The match needed calming down and normally this would come from the captains.&nbsp; However, when the French captain lunged&nbsp;at Guido&nbsp;with a ridiculous two-footed tackle the opposite occurred and everyone went bananas.&nbsp; <b>Kaos</b>.&nbsp; The French captain was lucky to escape with only a yellow and Guido was lucky to escape without injury.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Sanity was regained momentarily, before Toby's late lunge on a&nbsp;psychotic French defender set things off again.&nbsp; Dan fuelled the fiery flames with&nbsp;an incendiary remark when he said to&nbsp;the psycho&nbsp;&quot;Let's just play football,&quot;&nbsp;then all hell broke loose.&nbsp; <b>Karnage</b>!&nbsp; Amongst comments of &quot;Do you want to see Muay Thai?&quot;, the classic playground &quot;Who are you?&nbsp; Do you know who I am?&quot; and the rodonculous &quot;Do you want to see a bum in your face?&quot; (ED.) the match was sensibly called to a halt by the referee.&nbsp; <b>Krazy</b>.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										This match had it all, folks.&nbsp; At the feep, Sala 7 France 1.<br>
