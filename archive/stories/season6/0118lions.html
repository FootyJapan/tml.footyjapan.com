									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 18th January</b><br>
										<br>
										The Sunday late kick-off in Fukuda Denshi saw the bottom 2 clubs face each other, where a win for BEFC would mean them starting off their season in terms of points, and a win for Lions would mean a jump to the dizzy heights of mid-table, the least they expect with&nbsp;a game or 2 in hand. <br>
										Lions still scraping together a team due to injuries and holidays, were again offering a guest a starting place in the team. Lions were hoping for an unchanged team from Hibs game but their goal scorer Abu and striker Ahmed were both missing for a clash they would've enjoyed. <br>
										Lions started brightly, and a perfectly weighted chip from Tatsuya from 40 yards out was followed up by the excellent and consistent Charles, who got to the ball before the keeper and headed it past to score the opener within the first 15 minutes. <br>
										BEFC pressed, and a 25-yarder low shot hit the post and went out to safety. Lions hit back, and a corner was met by the debutant guest - Walter - who headed home the second for Lion to make it 2-0 half way through the first half. <br>
										A bit of confusion in the Lion's defence gifted BEFC an easy tap in at the far end to end the first half 2-1. <br>
										The second half saw a great lobbed pass followed up by Omar from midfield, whilst BEFC remain frozen, raising their arms for an offisde for an uninterfering Lions player, and with Omar through one-on-one with the keeper, to the releif of BEFC, the linesman and referee obliged and let them off by calling halt to the game as an offside. To be fair, BEFC's Fernando went over to his own linesman and explained to him the incorrect decision. <br>
										A BEFC corner kept bouncing back into the Lion's area and finally, a stylish overhead kick, saw a BEFC player hit the far top corner to bring BEFC level with little over 15 minutes to go. <br>
										Lions looked destined to draw with the bottom team after drawing with the top team the week before, and 5 minutes later things could've been worse when BEFC's Taki was clearly held back in the area, with Lion's subs shying away from what seemed to be a penalty and a possible booking or sending off. <br>
										Luckily, BEFC's complaints were ignored by the referee, and play was allowed to continue. Lions felt justice was done since BEFC's opener should not have counted for a clear foul from behind on the Lion's defender. <br>
										Tatsuya came on again after going off to rest a swollen ankle, and the infrom midfielder was in the middle of confusions in the BEFC box following a corner, and he smashed home Lions' 3rd with 10 minutes to go. <br>
										BEFC did not give up, and Alex caused a few problems, especially as he skipped the last defender only to shoot the ball straight at the advancing Orlando. Moments earlier, Orlando also rushed to the edge of the box to deny a BEFC striker, following an excellent through ball. <br>
										Zuhair worked hard upfront on his return to the team, and so did Arcadia at the opposite end in defence, but glittering perfromances and first goals this season from Charles and Tatsuya helped Lions secure a narrow win. <br>
										Man of the Match: The injured Tatsuya 'Tats' Ando for a great assist, and the winning goal&nbsp;.<br>
