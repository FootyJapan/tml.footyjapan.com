									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Monday 12th January</b><br>
										<br>
										Lions would like to start by wishing all the TML a Happy New Year, and wish that 2009 brings stability, prosperity, peace, and joy to all. <br>
										<br>
										Despite winning the Div 2 title last year, Lions have had an under par 2008 that saw them win only 6 games out of 16, compared to the fine run in 2007 of 10 wins in 14 that led to securing the Season 5 title. <br>
										<br>
										Lions have been struggling with absentees most significantly the Captain Somi, and Orlando Torres between the posts. <br>
										Their return on a freezing Monday night in Hachioji Park was marked by strong speeches from both, highlighting the anger at the humiliating 10-1 drubbing on the hands of YCAC, and reminding Lions who they are, and to go out and enjoy the game, and make sure we did not freeze ourselves for nothing. <br>
										<br>
										Lions were with only 1 recognised striker, Ahmed Gaafar, with the absentees list including Zuhair, Ken, Hideki, Ahmed, and Fisal. Lions were facing a big dilemma with non of their 5 centre-backs available, a few still on holiday, whilst Evis being suspended. <br>
										Gaafar Somi, a well known midfielder played as a centre-back, whilst Mo's idea of playing the attacking midfielder Arcadia as the other centre-back definetely paid off. <br>
										<br>
										Hibs started strongly, and a few scary moments arose when a 7 yard shot rattled off the cross-bar, only to be cleared by the anxious Lions defenders. Lions almost hit back immediately when a 25-yard free-kick saw Somi unleashing a scorcher, where the Hibs keeper was only able to parry the ball, but his follow up denied the pouncing Ahmed and Fahad a Lion's opener. <br>
										<br>
										Hibs kept probing and Lions kept absorbing the pressure and releasing the brilliant Abu every now and then causing concern for the Hibs defence. <br>
										<br>
										A deflected clearance saw a Hibs striker dash in, one-on-one with Orlando, but Arcadia dashed across and with what must be the best tackle of the season, blocked the shot into a corner. Had he mistimed the challenge, a penalty and sending off would've been the result! <br>
										<br>
										A 20-yard free-kick was well taken by Josh, but the dipping far-post shot was no match for Orlando. <br>
										<br>
										Tatsuya was found onside on the right flank and as he dashed towards the goal, his unselfish cross to the far post was bit too high for the attacking Ahmed. <br>
										<br>
										The first half finished 0-0, and the second half saw Lions field Matteo Symonds on the left as a guest player. Matteo showed pin-point accuracy with his passing, and as Tatsuya got involved in a move, Ahmed was released on the right, and as he out-paced the defenders and looked like taking a shot, he slipped an inch perfect ball to Abu who dragged the keeper and placed the ball into the empty net to allow Lions to lead 1-0 with 20 minutes to go. <br>
										By standers were amazed and commented on how Lions beat BFC, and are leading against the unbeaten Hibs, but managed to lose to teams in the lower end of the tables. <br>
										<br>
										Andre Pinto managed to skip through into the box, and he unleashed a shot into the near top corner, but amazing athletics from Orlando pushed the ball onto the cross-bar and out as a corner. <br>
										<br>
										Hibs continued to threat and another shot from the edge of the box cleared Orlando, only to comeback off the bar. <br>
										<br>
										A Lions corner almost saw Lions double their lead from a header, and minutes later, Ahmed's brilliant 30 yard dash should've seen the ball in the net, but Hibs managed to block his shot about 9 yards out. <br>
										<br>
										Hibs had plenty of free-kicks around the box, and their set play was well rehearsed, and as they managed to break the offside trap, their header luckily went too high, however with less than 5 minutes to go, a weighted free-kick saw their player head the ball backwards from 6 yards out, and despite Orlando getting a touch, the ball found its way into the net to deny Lions a memorable win. <br>
										<br>
										Charles and Mo Birkia were awesome as fullbacks, and kept limiting the crosses.&nbsp;<br>
										Both teams had absentees, with Hibs also missing Bevan, Ono, and Eduardo. <br>
										<br>
										Good refereeing from Quentin allowed us to enjoy a great contest between the two teams, where a draw seemed as a fair result. <br>
										<br>
										Lions will welcome back most of their squad for their next game, but surely on this performance, a starting XI change is unlikely. <br>
										<br>
										Man of the Match: Both teams were awesome, with none making any mistakes throughout the game, but my man of the match has to be Somi for his amazing performance as a defender infront of the great Orlando - nothing short of taking bullets for a president! <br>
