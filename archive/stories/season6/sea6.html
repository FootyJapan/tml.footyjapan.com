								<p><b>Legends, Roppongi, Friday, June 26th</b><br>
									Everybody knows that a TML season is never truly finished until we've all congregated at Legends stuffed ourselves with burgers, drowned ourselves in Heineken and listened to the drivel that's spouted from the gobs of those who've won awards.<br>
									Well done to the three champions of their respective divisions (pictured here): YCAC 1st X1 for getting their hands on the prize for the first time, FC International for winning their division &amp; being promoted two years on the spin (a first in TML - guess what there'll be aiming for this season in TML Div. 1 (teams be warned!!)) and El Diego a new team that no one really knows anything about except that they killed the 3rd Division and may, according to many, top the 2nd this season.<br>
									<img src="../../../mats/photos/09/eos/champs.jpg" alt="" height="135" width="581" border="0"><br>
									In the FJ Cup competition it was Hibs who came out tops, although no doubt their sights were set on the main prize - any silverware is better than none though (ask BFC). Big thanks to referee Quentin who has been with TML since its inception and has worked tirelessly on and off the field (yes the adjudicating, arbitration and mediating continues long after you've been sent off - although next season TML will be clamping right down on violent conduct and abusive behaviour towards referees - don't say we didn't warn you). We wish 'Q' and his family every success as they venture back to Canada (I think...).

									Even before the final game of TML season 6 was played, the new Magnificent 7's Summer League kicked off in style, as BFC took a flying start.<br>
									Maritizio were left lying at the foot of Division 2 as a resurgent JETRO FC completed their season in style with a 6-0 victory, edging their way into 3rd place. This rescheduled match concluded a very thrilling season for the Division 2 teams, who right up to the end only had a few points separating the promotion places from relegation spots.<br>
									Just before this final game, the all new M7's league kicked off with BFC &amp; Shane playing against Panthers &amp; Zion. A very quick and skillfully BFC made easy work of both their oppositions, taking advantage of the small pitches with large goals, scoring a total of 13 goals.&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="http://www.footyjapan.com/pages/magnificent7s.html#m7results" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

The three new cheerleaders that BFC recently recruited, whose combined age came to about 57 (seriously), seemed to enjoy every minute of it.

									Fill a bag with poo and punch it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like last year, that's the only way to describe&nbsp;another explosive encounter between Sala and France.&nbsp; So explosive, in fact, that&nbsp;Napolean and Nelson would have, respectively, found their diminutive stature and lack of&nbsp;appendages&nbsp;too inadequate to take part in this tumultuous battle. And, what a stonking score to go with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;7-1 to the Sala,&nbsp;with two players bagging hatricks, no less than 5 yellow cards!! <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0222sala.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Even though it involved a team that specializes in against-the-odds victories, this game would have had William Hill and Paddy Power scratching each other's heads in disbelief. Mauritzio had a 14-man squad that looked much more capable than their lowly league position would suggest. The Albion Old Boys played almost the whole game with ten men, three of whom would have been substituted for injuries had the option been available. Nevertheless it was the limping veterans who were on the right end of a 7-3 scoreline that takes them firmly into nosebleed territory at the top end of Division 2. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0221aob.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>Hachioji Park, Saturday 26th September</b><br>
									The Hibs have had the better of the Geckoes over the past few seasons, compiling over twenty goals in the last four meetings, but we&rsquo;d heard rumours of their renewed squad including a tall kiwi midfielder and a few speedy and skilful Japanese. We&rsquo;d also noted their draw against the YCAC and win over the Swiss; so the Hibs went into this match expecting a tough and close game. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0926hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									To say the Swiss have suffered from the loss of key players recently is like saying that global financial markets are currently experiencing a bit of a rough trot. While two seasons ago the Hibs lost a large chunk of our electrifying 05/6 five goal a game squad, we were very fortunate to recruit some great players to step in soon after. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0920hibs.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Different captain, same sort of result. Early days but Morson's first competitive game in charge ended in a 5-0 evisceration of Saitama JETs in sweaty conditions more suited to sucking ice lollies down at the beach. There was also nice symmetry for BFC in reversing that humiliating Cup final defeat by the Little Green Men.<br>
									<br>
									Aranda scoring twice, once from the spot, and Day snapping up one from close range continued a theme from last season but BFC will do well to produce a better goal than Taka's scorcher which put BFC 2-0 up.<br>

									</b>After a well-deserved mauling by the Panthers in their first league outing, the Saitama Jets 2nds returned to form with a 3-0 win over the hapless Guarana Republic. Having squeezed past the men in green 4-0 and 3-0 last season, the Jets could be forgiven for starting this game full of confidence. In fact, for the first 15 or 20 minutes, Guarana barely got out of their own half. <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0914jets2.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

								<p><b>Yoyogi NHK, Saturday 6th Sept</b>,<b>.</b><br>
									A sunny September Saturday in Yoyogi was the scene for the Geckoes second and Swiss' first TML fixture of the new season. As the teams made their way to the pitch from Harajuku station they couldn't help but notice two important events taking place nearby, first the Tokyo Girls Collection.....ah....erm...and, oh yes, more importantly of course the Brasil Festival in Yoyogi Park. At one stage we actually had to squeeze through as a drum and dance troop who had come all the way from Brazil (though looked suspiciously local) had basically blocked the road and was putting on a good pre-game show. Good start for the Geckoes even before kickoff knowing we'd be pulling on yellow kits before long.<br>
									<br>
									Manager Simon Bromwell, his second game in charge, had a young team looking fit and ready to samba dance the ball right through the Swiss. A far cry from the days of old when the closest thing considered Brazilian dancing by the Geckoes was after midnight in the pong, thinking they look good in the mirror doing the robot next to (the soon to be scooped up by Ronaldo) Isabella...so I'm told! <a class="txlink" href="http://footjapan.com/archive/stories/season6/0906WSG.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									They say to be champions of the TML you have to be able to win ugly, and this has been proved year-in-year-out by the aesthetically challenged players of the previous 5 TML championship winning teams (with the exception of Jon Day, who as everyone knows is dead gorgeous). If this is the case this season, the best the Geckoes and YCAC can expect is to end up towards upper mid-table, with both teams seeming more than happy to draw prettily<b>.</b>&nbsp; <a class="txlink" href="0823WSG.html" target="_blank">more ...</a><br>

									Having been part of the team since it began (this time last year) I have seen many changes to the Tokyo Panthers team, the way we play and the score lines. The score lines have got better, the players faster (and it seems younger!!) and the team more fluid. This was definitely the case for our first game of the season.<br>
