									<p><b>Misato, Sunday 19th October</b><br>
										I approach this match report with a lot of trepidation! After our previous report everything is just second best and my skills certainly do not lay in writing. Still, the only person I could have forced to do it (nice yellow card Andy!) as a punishment was washing the kit! So that puts this lovely job back in my court.<br>
										<br>
										Every time we play at Misato I feel like I have to begin preparations to get there at least three days in advance, getting the route to the station, an ordnance survey map for the route from the station and a GPS just in case. Still most of the team arrived on time, sadly we started (and finished) the game with a man down, not the ideal way to face the team at the top of the division. I guess it could have been worse, had Kev not turned up we would have been two down!<br>
										<br>
										After some tactical discussion we decided to take the wind on in the first half and paid for it with a looping corner delivered into the centre of the box, their striker got a slight connection on it to put it past Graham who looked more like he was trying to take off than save the ball from the net. Still, not ones to go down without a fight we started to get the ball forward, this resulted in us winning a corner too! With uncharacteristic skill and precision Chris volleyed a lovely corner from our resident Russian in Japan, Mikhail. The ball cut a line straight past the bewildered goalie into the back of the net. We cheered and clapped Chris on the back, it was not to remain this way. Sensing our weakness at the back (three at the back Romen???) they started pinging balls over the top of us for their rapid (for Division 3!!) strikers.<br>
										In a rare (for the first half) movement forward George was taken down by a heavy tackle (very much the Emile Heskey of the team) while sitting dazed the Shane goalie recieved the ball and decided that he would do his good Samaritan bit and check George was ok. They say a good deed doesn&rsquo;t go unpunished and it was certainly the case as Jorge pointed to the edge of the box and gave a free kick for holding the ball! Shame Kev launched it into orbit!<br>
										After some valiant defending Andy passed the ball to one of our midfield players, well, he thought it was a midfield player but due to the Ref&rsquo;s interesting choice of colours it went straight passed him to the Shane attack force. We have decided that Jorge is now an Honorary Panther as he both looked like one and received the ball like one!!<br>
										Toby was the unlucky defender that ended up dealing with the result of this pass which led to one of the more difficult up and overs and due to a good connection on the ball from the striker, we conceded another goal. <br>
										You may recall last weeks match report and the author&rsquo;s criticism of team negativity, if not here it is!! &#150;<br>
										<br>
										 &ldquo;We all play well most of the time, and crap now and again, so no more scrapping between ourselves, please. Tolerance of occasional mediocrity will help us get into the Top 3.&rdquo;<br>
										<br>
										This seemed to go right out of the window after the second goal as the previous author decided to let rip both barrels at our intrepid goalie! The vitriol was evident as the two verbally abused each other for a couple of minutes. All was ok at half time as the two shook hands and got over it!<br>
										<br>
										Half time allowed us to get some fluids in and swap ends, now we were going to get our goals back! With the change we got the added help of the wind, it was like having 3 extra players! Almost immediately we were ripping the ball up the field and pinging crosses into the box. For twenty minutes we created a siege like situation keeping most of the yellow shirts in their box! Even I managed to cross a couple of balls in to the box and I was playing at the back with only 2 other defenders!<br>
										<br>
										Having decided that there were insufficient UFO sightings in Japan, Kev attempted not only to show up on Narita&rsquo;s radar but to launch the first human powered satellite into orbit, I have to say the million dollar prize may go to the Panthers for their recent attempts! <br>
										<br>
										The only problem with these &ldquo;shots&rdquo; is that the ball tends to be lost in the swamp that exists behind the goal. After our first expedition to search for the ball we decided it would be wise to be more prepared for the second. So we wipped out our Swiss Army knives, snake and mosquito repellent and khaki hats. This proved invaluable as we were searching for some time!<br>
										<br>
										So back to the action. After winning a corner Chris wipped the ball in where it was knocked to the feet of Mikhail who promptly slashed at it give the ball an evil spin which found it&rsquo;s way into the back of the net, the goalie stood astounded with nothing but air between his hands. We were on track!<br>
										<br>
										Shane of course were having none of this and decided to attack, probing down our right wing the attack came again and again and managed to pass the midfield and the ball came into my area of the pitch. Due to some fancy footwork and pace their winger got past me with too much ease, as such a flying tackle from behind which took the ball was in order, as it happens it worked and the ball was knocked off the attacker for a throw.<br>
										<br>
										Having a few minutes of rest our attackers decided enough was enough and we started probing for a third. This time Tom received an inspired cross from myself that carved their defense in half and resulted in a fantastic third goal for the Panthers! We kept pushing forward and attacking but Shane weren&rsquo;t going to let the game die there and in the last five minutes they took advantage of the weary legs of the defense and knocked a ball past me and ran on towards goal. Graham came out and dealt with the threat but due to a series of unfortunate incidents their defender, whilst prone, knocked a hopeful and soft shot towards goal. We could only watch as the ball dribbled over the line. 3-3. <br>
										<br>
										Despite getting forward and having a few chances they decided to lock it up at the back and with there entire team behind the ball we just couldn&rsquo;t break through. <br>
										<br>
										The game ended a draw but the Panthers were left with the feeling if it weren&rsquo;t for being a man down, no subs and those pesky kids, we would taken the three points!<br>
