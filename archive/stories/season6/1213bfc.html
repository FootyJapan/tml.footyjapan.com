									<p><b>Hchioji Park, Saturday 13th December</b><br>
										<br>
										BFC&nbsp;went into this game confident that if we played&nbsp;our best&nbsp;we could beat&nbsp;the in-form Hibs. Instead, we came away with nothing, although, to a man, you couldn't fault the effort. It was a massive game for both clubs and&nbsp;everyone knew what was at stake. If BFC lost so they lost their title. BFC did lose and it looks as if, bar divine intervention, the Hibs will be champions. With both the Swiss and Sala re-building and&nbsp;YCAC having already lost twice to&nbsp;Hibs it's hard to see where they will drop points.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										The game itself was not a classic. BFC were missing key players in Shosuke and Pabs and cruelly lost our centre mid to injury on 15 minutes,&nbsp;while Bevan was absent for Hibs. The first half was even, you could even say BFC edged it -&nbsp;hitting the bar twice, the side netting once and missing a couple of other good chances. Hibs had 3 good chances too - one free kick off the bar, one long range effort expertly saved by BFC's 17 year old GK -&nbsp;Bryan Yonamine and a 30 yard screamer into the top corner. 1-0 half-time.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Team talk and tangerines later, BFC knew what we had to do. Unfortunately for us, we were met by a younger, fitter Hibs' team that, to a man, are confident talented footballers. Keita&nbsp;and the new J-league recruit in midfield were both outstanding. It was&nbsp;about containment as BFC struggled to create while&nbsp;Hibs&nbsp;poured forward. Full credit to them&nbsp;- they had an excellent 45 minutes and were by far the better team in the&nbsp;2nd half. A second goal&nbsp;from McGirr's head (who was the marker - the inquiry continues...?), after which BFC missed a penalty....2-1 with 20 to go would have been a very different story, but&nbsp;actually traffic was&nbsp;almost one way from that point. With all three BFC centre backs&nbsp;getting cramp, it was no surprise when a&nbsp;weak 3rd came courtesy of a mix up in BFC's defence.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										3-0 was the final score. Perhaps a bit harsh on BFC who deserved at least a goal but the overall result was the right one.<br>
										<br>
										as a footnote, the author would like to add that in the 25+ years he's been playing football he's come across many un-gentlemanly acts on the pitch - playing in various leagues at various standards from playground to Hackney Marshes to&nbsp;semi-pro. I've been punched, pushed, kicked, intentionally fouled ending up in plaster, had people refuse to shake hands after the game, name calling, handbags&nbsp;etc. But we can all take that right. It goes with the territory. What I can't take and what has happened to me only twice - both times in TML&nbsp;-&nbsp;is being spat on. Whether or not it did happen (of course the culprits, who shall remain nameless, deny it - despite one of them looking me in the eye as he spat at me with his&nbsp;back to the ref) is not the point I want to make. The point is that spitting is the most cowardly, disgusting, unhygienic and low-life act that you can do to another player, not to mention it's assault. You're little better than animals and we know who you are.<br>
