									<p><b>YC&amp;AC Sunday 22nd February</b><br>
										I`m reluctant to say anything about the Vags 1-2 loss to YCAC2 last Sunday morning, but the superb Vags goal deserves a mention. I might be less reluctant if we`d been hammered. 1-0 up and settling in for a long awaited rout, a little bit of good fortune for YCAC&#150; a penalty and free kick, both converted &#150; and a second half surrender from the Vagabonds swung this game for our grisly opponents.<br>
										<br>
										It must be a nightmare to be a Vagabonds fan this season. Beginning games at a gallop and scoring our one goal quota in the first half minutes to take the lead, only to watch it all slip away as the game wears on and we get daydreaming, concede a silly goal and then one or two others. Too much fast food, I reckon, is to blame for the short attention span &#150; about twenty minutes max.<br>
										<br>
										After this game, you could see narrowed eyes glancing slyly around to see who was to blame, or who was looking to blame back for us losing. Half of the team scarpered immediately after the game. They, to a man, got blamed.<br>
										<br>
										Now the goal. Following some left wing action, the ball was tapped inside to Muzzy who turned his defender and left him standing, strode a couple of paces across the front of the box to get balanced and walloped his shot over the keepers fingertips into the top corner. Ferocious spin as well.<br>
										<br>
										Then YCAC got a penalty when Nao chested the ball with his arms glued to his side, as is his wont, and the referee made a nonsense decision. Their momentum gathered, another set piece followed and Dennis Hastert from YCAC counted out his own ten steps - the referee was no use to him he made quite clear &#150; then mullahed a low shot past Graham.<br>
										<br>
										My spirits are nosediving now. The second half was scrappy and goalless. The Vags showed little ingenuity in attack but actually didn't quite surrender as I said earlier. They just sort of slowly resigned. Alright, surrendered. <br>
