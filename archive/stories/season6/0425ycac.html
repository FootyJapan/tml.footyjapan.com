									<p><b>YCAC, Saturday, April 18th</b><br>
										...and then there was one. Only one team stands between YCAC and its 1st TML title; our visitors this Wednesday night, The Hibs. Just three more points for all the marbles but anything less probably leaves&nbsp; the boys in Green as the 1st 3-time TML Champs. One of their final 3 opponents, Sala, Swiss and France would have to beat them if they take a point from Wednesdays showdown. Sala! How delicious a Sala win to give YCAC the title would be. Years of futility for us against them and them against Hibs (10-1 anyone?) banished by a single result. I might rename my 3 boys Guido, Toby and Brookey, or not.<br>
										<br>
										Let&rsquo;s not even go there though. It would just be cleaner for everyone involved if the job got done on Wednesday, 1st against 2nd, mano a mano, to the Victor the Spoils, etc. We've been here before, to a degree at least. Unknown to anyone at the time, the winners of the same game at the end of TML1, Hibs 1-0 as it turned out, were destined to be crowned Champs thanks to the later navigational ineptitude of the Swiss. Sala, on that occasion, helping Hibs to the title. Make sense? Possibly only to those of us with a sense of TML history<br>
										<br>
										The French were creditable opponents earlier this season and, according to Yannick, fielded one of their stronger squads again on Saturday. That and the abysmal conditions meant that YCAC were never going to make a serious challenge to the Hibs goal difference, now no longer an issue. Tyson Masar, preyer on the very young and the elderly, bully of the infirm, scourge of the afflicted and general kicker of guide dogs missed 3 early chances to put some more daylight between him and Andre Pinto in the race for the new boots which, incidentally, he won't be here to collect so should be a size 28.5 and predominately black.&nbsp; <br>
										<br>
										It was left to sidekick, Hide Yoshioka, to grab the plaudits in his 1st full game back after hamstring knack had wiped out most of his March and April football. 2 1st half strikes and a 3rd halfway through the 2nd just as France were threatening to make a game of it proved to be enough for the necessary 3 points. All 3 were close range finishes, the last a tap in from a perfect cross lashed in from the puddles wide right by Tyson.<br>
										<br>
										That was to be our token Americans final contribution to the cause. Moments later, having plainly beaten the French offside trap he smashed the ball home anyway after the &ldquo;Ref&rdquo; had blown for &ldquo;offside&rdquo; This vicious act of petulance earned young Tyse&#x2026;a straight red. The world stopped as the enormity of the decision hit the rest of the team. There was a stunned silence for what seemed like an eternity during which the only sounds audible were me losing control of my bodily functions-again-and faint cheering from the direction of Paddy Foleys. A very surreal moment as nobody even questioned the &ldquo;Refs&rdquo; decision. After all this was the &ldquo;Ref&rdquo; that &ldquo;Reffed&rdquo; his 1st match at YCAC without a watch and blew for full time 20 minutes early because his ketai alarm went off. <br>
										The TML &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; are either a patient or a desperate lot. Thankfully, our hero eventually swapped yellow for red and Tyson earned a temporary reprieve. Temporary because he was immediately substituted to spend the rest of the match soaked and seething on the sideline out of harm&rsquo;s way. Quite bizarre and perhaps only explainable&nbsp; if the inclement weather meant that the &ldquo;Ref&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t see the colour of the card an arm&rsquo;s length away. That would have explained a few other things too, frankly<br>
										<br>
										Defences ruled throughout the game and the goalkeeping was commendable given the ugly conditions. The pitch held up remarkably well except for some surface water down the wings. Be careful of what you wish for though. A nice grass pitch would have meant we could have all stayed home out of the cold and rain. The forecast for Wednesday is bright and clear, ideal for the big game. Get the shopping done early and get yourself up to YCAC for the 7.15 KO. There&rsquo;ll be beers and burgers and, hopefully, a bit of a game on<br>
