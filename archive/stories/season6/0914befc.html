									<p><b>Hachioji Park, Sunday 14th September</b>,,<br>
										
										It wouldn`t have been inconceivable for this game to have ended up 9-9. In an open andentertaining affair under the floodlights in Hachioji, Sala finally edged it, but the Embassy showed more than enough to suggest that this season is one of great promise. <br>
										From the off, both sides were looking to knock the ball around, and it was the Embassy who took charge with the triumvirate of Takanori, Osamu and Tetsu causing real problems for the Sala back line. After around ten minutes, from a quickly taken free kick, Osamu crossed perfectly for last seasons leading-marksmen Crouchie to tap home. <br>
										The Embassy doubled their lead soon after, when following some great combative work from Ferdy, followed by a slide-rule pass, Crouchie blasted home his second. Sala were visibly rocking and the Embassy were playing full of confidence. <br>
										A bolt out of the blue from Toby, shorlty before half time changed the complexion of the game, however. Following some neat interplay down the left, their number 10 Toby Long, hit a belter into the top-corner beyond the outstretched reach of Keith, who had until thenstopped everything thrown at him. <br>
										Sala were back in it, and following a rocket at half-time, came out in the second half stretching the Embassy and causing problems with crosses into the box. Following one such cross, Keith unfortunately punched the ball against the back of the Sala centre back's head to equalize. <br>
										The fact that it was 2-2 was harsh on the Embassy; chances had been spurned. Sil, Hal, Eddie and Crouch all carved out good openings but couldn`t find the target. At the same time Keith had been simply unbelievable between the sticks, tipping over some raspers, as well as getting down low to claw out or block other efforts. For the neutrals (of which there were none), it was great to watch. <br>
										And so to the final sting in the tail. Another long-ranger, this time low into the corner with five left to go, left the Embassy with nothing. They could have even snatched an equalizer but Crouchies header went just over at the death. Plenty to take from the game, but losing this one was more than hard to swallow. <br>
										<br>
										Man of the match: Keith - belied his 49-years with some quite fantastic saves. <br>
