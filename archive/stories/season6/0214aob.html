									<p><b>OiFuto, Saturday 14th February</b><br>
										Talk about going against your best interests. Like George Best scratching the stitches above his freshly-transplanted liver with one hand while pouring himself a pint of vodka with the other, the Albion Old Boys just can't seem to keep their spirit bottled up, as even the knowledge that a victory would place them them firmly in the unwelcome territory of the Division Two promotion battle couldn't stop them from putting in another committed display to overcome the BFC Vagabonds with a hard-earned but well-deserved 4-2 win.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Back in September these two teams had shared eight goals in a cracking game at Hachioji Koen, and despite the ridiculously unseasonable 21 degree temperature and the obligatory Oifuto sea breeze, this return encounter didn't disappoint, with plenty of good football played in a hard but fair spirit. The Old Boys struck first when Rob MacGregor whipped in a wicked inswinging corner that didn't require any third-party intervention to find the back of the net. &quot;OK lads, concentration now. We've got the goal. Let's keep it really tight for the next ten minu....Fcuk!&quot;. And so the Vags were instantly back on level terms as an indecisive clearance was smashed home very decisively. The Old Boys had the better chances to get the go-ahead goal - Naoki Ogasawara hit the bar from six yards out after the Vags keeper had gifted possession, and a minute or so later the keeper made amends by tipping over a goal-bound left-foot shot from James Moon. Yes, that is correct. No, definitely not a typing error &nbsp;- a left-foot shot from James Moon. In fact there must be something in the soil of Oifuto 1 that makes the Albion midfielder bloom more brightly, because in addition to that shot, and to an overall impressively industrious day's work in front of the Old Boy's back four, it was James who gave Albion that go-ahead goal with a net-rippling volley from the edge of the box that bore more than a passing similarity to the one he scored at the other end of the same ground a few games ago.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										So at half-time with sunscreen supplies dwindling at an alarming pace it was 2-1 to the rapidly-reddening boys in blue. And in the second half it was again the Old Boys who provided the greater goal threat, so it was no great surprise when they extended their lead. Centre forward Andrew Morrison showed the combination of power and technique that had troubled the Vagabonds defence all game has he held off two defenders, turned and fired home for 3-1. Vagabonds tried to rally, but though they had some skillful passages of play, they didn't have enough creativity in the final third to pose a threat to an Albion defence in which everyone was playing well. And then when the Old Boys got a free kick out wide fairly deep in the Vagabonds half Mark Van Den Bossche said to Naoki, &quot;I'll be Bobby Moore, you be Geoff Hurst&quot;, and Naoki duly obliged with a glancing near post header that would have had both Alf Ramsey and Ron Greenwood nodding their approval. 4-1, and no way back for the Vagabonds, though they did grab a late consolation goal to make the score a better reflection of the closeness of the contest.<br>
