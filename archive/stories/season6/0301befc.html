									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday 1st March</b><br>
										Hibs vs BEFC, Top vs bottom, Goal difference: plus 46 vs minus 34. Hibs&rsquo; top marksmen had scored the same number of goals as the entire Embassy team, for christ&rsquo;s sake! Surely this was the most uneven match-up since the inception of TML. The Hib&rsquo;s won of course, but they certainly knew they&rsquo;d been in a game, and BEFC can be proud of their performance.<br>
										<br>
										BEFC headed into their first game at the recently laid astro at YC&amp;AC without three first choice defenders, giving a debut to Paul (the &lsquo;lazy&rsquo; ref) as a sweeper as the Embassy went for damage limitation; 5-4-1, on the back of a 9-1 mauling earlier in the season. For the first five minutes, it seemed like the Hibs might outdo that score as they swept forward in wave after wave. But after riding the initial storm, the Embassy settled down with Craig and Rob doing diligent man-marking jobs and allowing Paul to sweep up behind.<br>
										<br>
										Hibs&rsquo; usual flowing passing game was being disrupted by disciplined positioning and biting tackles and they were becoming frustrated, when finally, midway through the half, they unlocked the defense and slotted past Eddie, who was to go on and make a string of fine saves throughout the game. Rather than capitulate, the Embassy rallied. Alex had already had a left-foot rasper brilliantly tipped over the bar, when the Embassy fashioned an equalizer. Some great work down the left by Tetsu, and Steve getting on the end of the cross to slot in his first for the club. 1-1 &#150; you what?<br>
										<br>
										Sadly for BEFC, it couldn&rsquo;t last. Conceding a goal just before half time was followed up after the break by two more, putting the Hibs into an unassailable lead. That wasn&rsquo;t the whole story though. Takanori was having a personal dual with the Hibs keeper who made at least three excellent saves from cracking strikes. Masaya, who never stopped down the left flank, came close too. Finally they did get some reward; a determined run into the box from Paul ending with him being felled and Takanori calmly struck in the resulting penalty, 4-2. Within a minute though, Hibs had restored their 3 goal cushion, a deflected effort looping up over the stranded Eddie.<br>
										<br>
										The game ended in controversy with a Hibs defender given his marching orders for appearing to strike out at Takanori as he went through on goal. This time, however, the Hibs keeper guessed right and saved the spot kick, leaving the final score at 5-2 to the Hibs.<br>
										<br>
										The Embassy though will be buoyed by this display, and while a great escape like the one last season looks highly unlikely, this performance should give encouragement for the last few games of the season.<br>
