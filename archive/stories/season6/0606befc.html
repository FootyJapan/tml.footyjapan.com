									<p><b>Hodogaya koen, Saturday, June 6th</b><br>
										Going into this game against the fourth-placed Geckoes, the British Embassy sat like a dead weight at the foot of the table &#150; a mere three points, and without a win all season, you&rsquo;d have forgiven them for not turning up at all. They did, however, unlike the referee who had lost his wallet, and the game began with Satoshi making the calls, not that he had much to do, as the game was played out with few contentious moments. <br>
											The Embassy began brightly, echoing the determination spouted pre-match, to end the season on a high. Calm in possession, confidently knocking the ball around, the first half was as well as BEFC had played all season, and unlike previous encounters found the goals to reflect it. Skipper for the day Alex benefited from some ricochets before poking home the opener, and doubled his tally when he latched on to a slide rule pass from Takanori to give the Embassy a thoroughly deserved 2-0 half-time lead. Indeed, it could have been more; Takanori was narrowly wide with some audacious long-range efforts, and `Jimmy` Burns saw a goal-bound volley blocked. The midfield three were buzzing &#150; Masaya winning and distributing the ball well, and Craig and Tetsu always offering outlets from wide. The defense stood firm when the Geckoes pushed forward with Ian and Rob getting some good blocks in and headers away, and Tim and Richie tracking the wingers well.<br>
											In the second half the Geckoes came into it much more and grabbed a goal back when number 15 squeezed a shot off from the angle inside the far post. At this point so many times this season BEFC have capitulated, but not today. They coped well with their Achilles heel &#150; corners &#150; of which the Geckoes must have had 15, and no mean feat defending against the tallest side in the league from set-plays. Keith got some crucial punches away and follow-ups were blocked as bodies went on the line to protect the lead. The storm was weathered though, and the Embassy re-found their rhythm and poise. A ball across the box was spilled by the keeper and `Jimmy` pounced to make it 3, and Takanori wrapped it up with a goal his performance thoroughly deserved, coolly wrong-footing a couple of defenders before rifling it home. A fantastic effort from Kei could have made it even more emphatic but his shot from distance bounced down from bar to line and away. Final score 4-1 to the BEFC.<br>
											And so the season long curse was lifted, leaving it to the final day for their first and only win, and in doing so avoiding the indignity of being the first side to go a whole season without one. Hard to begrudge the Embassy their post-game celebrations. Week-in week-out they`d turned out, more often than not put in a decent performance and walked away with nothing. The spankings at times handed out to them had hurt, and yet the squad had kept turning up and giving it a go. This win made it seem somehow all worthwhile, and at the same time reminded us all of what a good side they can be when they have the confidence to knock it around. Roll on next season!<br>
