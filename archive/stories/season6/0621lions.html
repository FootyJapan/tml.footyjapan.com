									<p><b>YC&amp;AC, Sunday, June 21st</b><br>
										Saturday night in YCAC was the ground for a clash that if ended in a draw would see France relegated, and a win for either Lions or Swiss Kickers would see the other drop into Div 2.<br>
										Until the night before, Lions were having the luxury of having the full strength squad for only the second time this season, with over 20 players lining up for 16 positions. However, due to the unforeseen circumstances of Friday night, Lions were down to about 17 players, but still at full strength.<br>
										<br>
										Lions reverted to the 4-4-1-1 formation that proved effective against BFC and Hibs this season, with the likes of Captain Somi returning after a 5 month absence, but starting on the bench most notably alongside the talented striker Zuhair, with Abu playing behind Ken Hersche.<br>
										<br>
										Lions flowing footballing style returned, especially with the return of Hideki and last year's top scorer Ken, who were only playing their 5th match this season! No wonder Lions missed the pair!<br>
										Lions dominated the first half, and Abu's trickery was fruitful as his perfectly laid ball across the 'D' was eyed up calmly by Ken as he smashed home at the top right corner against Karl Hahne the man who co-setup the Swiss Kickers 18 years ago with Anton Hersche?.Ken's dad!<br>
										5 minutes later, Abu's trickery down the left and great link up with Hideki on the left wing and Charley (playing out of position as left-back), saw the ball squeezed into the box and cut-back at the near post for Fahad to slot the 2nd.<br>
										A deja vu of the 2nd goal was in the making, this time Ken slotting the 3rd to make the first half finish at 3-0.<br>
										Evis, Yasu, and debutant Kevin were having a brilliant half in defence, with Kevin having one of the best debuts I have seen.<br>
										Omar, Fahad, Hideki and Acai dictated the midfield, but in the second half, Karl's re-introduction from goal-to-sub-to-striker started causing problems for Lions. Karl started to win most balls in the air against Lions defence, and his flick-ons were perfect for the on-rushing strikers, and Lions defenders were worked very hard.<br>
										Karl started a flick-on, and with Lions confusion in defence with Orlando rushing out, saw the back passed ball clear Orlando and land in the net to make it 3-1&nbsp; ten minutes into the second half.<br>
										5 minutes later, Karl was causing all sorts of problems, and a ball that was not cleared well, fell to the experienced Karl, who gave the Swiss hope by scoring the 2nd.<br>
										Lions had to make changes, and Omar gave way to Captain Somi, whose experience was badly missed, and very much welcomed at a worrying period.<br>
										Somi was the architect on a move that saw Ken unleash a fierce shot from the edge of the box, only to see the ball hit the underside of the goal, hit the ground, and bounce away from the goal. It was an England 1966 kinda shot, so hard for the referee Quentin to call, and he allowed play to deny Ken his hattrick.<br>
										Zuhair was then introduced for the brilliant Ken, and a few minutes later, the sharp striker went past 2 defenders and with the keeper rooted a few yards out, Zuhair amazingly slotted wide from 6 yards out!<br>
										The Swiss kept pressurising and with Yasu tired, and Evis getting a cramp, Acai had to slot into central defence, and Aziz was introduced for the first time this season, as well as the Tatsuya on the wing for Hideki.<br>
										The pace of Tatsuya and Aziz started pegging the Swiss back again, and both players almost scored, Aziz's 20 yard run and shot was eventually blocked 12 yards out, and Tatsuya's cross-goal low shot scraped the far post as Lions players piled up into the net as they slid to make contact.<br>
										A scary moment for Lions saw a shot parried by Orlando, but the safe keeper followed up and held onto the ball.<br>
										Karl then hit a screamer from a direct free-kick which could've caused problems, but was well-blocked by the Lions wall.<br>
										A far post cross saw Aziz head the ball back across goal for Fahad who on the volley made it 4-2 to Lions with 5 minutes to go.<br>
										The Swiss then had a player sent-off to wrap up their night.<br>
										All Lions players were great, with Acai and Charley playing in all positions they were asked of, Fahad scoring a brace! What more can you ask of a defensive midfielder?!<br>
										Credit to the Swiss Kickers, they played well, but unfortunately they were faced by one of the strongest Lions squad this season.<br>
										It is always good to see both newly promoted teams stay up, and they did so with Lions ahead of France in the same order they topped Div 2.<br>
										&nbsp;<br>
										Karl, a great player, who proves talent is more important than age!<br>
										PS: Dutch Embassy... Glad to dissapoint you... and hopefully see you in the Cup next season.. since it seems the only way we can meet in the near future.&nbsp;<br>
										<b>Man of the Match:</b> Hard to choose from a fantastic performance, but the narrowest I can do is the trio of Abu, Ken, and Fahad!<br>
