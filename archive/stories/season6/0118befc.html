									<p><b>Fukuda Denshi, Sunday 18th January</b><br>
										BEFC went into this fixture pointless and on the back of some recent demoralizing defeats. Up against a Lions side, who on the back of a creditable draw with the Hibs the previous week, were looking up rather than down, the (imaginary) bookmakers gave the Embassy little hope. However, from the off, the Embassy took control, knocking the ball around with a confidence bellying their position, and with the return of Alex and Hal working neatly in tandem, created some nervy moments for the Lions backline. <br>
											Typically though, for all their good work, the Embassy fell behind. A nice move down the left from the Lions saw Charles get to the ball between keeper and defender to glance in the opener. Again, the Embassy fought back, Alex toe-ending one onto the post and it looked as though the equalizer was on its way when another sucker punch smacked them full-frontal. (Don&rsquo;t whisper it too loudly but if you play the Embassy, get them to concede some corners &#150; they don&rsquo;t deal with them too well) &#150; 2-0. At this point, recent capitulations must have played on the Embassy&rsquo;s mind, but rather than timidly recoil, they rallied back to pull level. <br>
											Before half-time, Satoshi&rsquo;s persistence saw him charge down a clearance, and Hal kept wonderfully composed to find Al at the back stick to slot home. Into the second half and the Embassy managed to equalize. This time, the Lions failed to clear a corner, and Craig took full advantage by acrobatically scoring his first for the club. And, for the first time since the opening two games of the season, it felt like we were going to win. The roars of a sensed victory were not coming from the Lions, but, as in those first two games, things conspired against us, and the Embassy went home with nothing.<br>
											Taka Y, who wears his heart on his sleeve powered into the area and was manhandled by the Lions defender (admitted as much in their very own match report &#150; hats off to you boys for your honesty post-game, as you were on the pitch &#150; the game was played in decent spirits), tried to stay on his feet but eventually went to ground and as the ref waved play-on, we knew, we all knew. Yes, the Lions won it, another failed clearance from a corner &#150; same old story. And though he was sitting from the confines of his chair in Funabashi supping on a chu-hi, I could hear Mark in the wind &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve gone and done it again!&rdquo;<br>
										<br>
										Man of the match: It could have gone to any one of us but special mentions to Eddie who was imperious at the back, snarling full-backs Richie and Tim, and Ferdy and Will in the middle who didn&rsquo;t give the Lions a minute&rsquo;s peace.<br>
