												<td><P><B>March 6th 2005 Nodai, Maritizio 3 v 2 BFC</b><BR>
												Nodai was the setting for a very importing game which Maritizio's simply 
had to win to sustain some form of hope for staying in contention to 
escape the relegation zone.  On a fine Sunday morning therefore, the 
scene was set for this showdown with BFC who could be forgiven for 
assuming that it would be just another walk in the park.  Indeed, how 
wrong this turned out to be.   From the kickoff a familiar pattern from 
Maritizios point of view had already developed, whereby it was all hands 
on deck to stem the initial early controlled onslaught from BFC. Mid way 
through the half however, Maritizio's fortuitousness came to bare once 
again, when a penalty was awarded for a seemingly unnecessary 
challenge by the BFC keeper 'Sid'.  Vernon Gill stood fast to punish BFC 
with a precise &amp; cleverly placed shot with the BFC keeper not hardly moving. 
Confidence then reined through the now very much up-beat Maritizio side 
that then went on to create several more chances before half time. Both 
teams fairly even at this stage.<BR>
It was the second half however that produces a more thrilling story to 
tell.   Early during the second half BFC seized on a needless error by the 
Maritizio goalkeeper which provided a gifted header for the BFC forward. 
All square it is again then. 10 minutes or so were to follow before Maritizio 
showed reminisance of their former sprit which they had yet all too often 
failed to manifest. A long ball was played from midfield to the Maritizio left 
wing who was able to outrun the slower BFC defense and calmly slide the 
ball past an on-coming BFC keeper.  With only 10miuntes or so left to play 
BFC heads noticeably slumped, clearly attributed to their own frustration 
with not being to penetrate the now sturdy &amp; assured Maritizio defense, 
with sloppy passing.  Now, seemingly in real despair BFC adopted 
a 'Charge of the Light Brigade' style attack, throwing everything at 
Maritizio.  This somehow ultimately paid off when too Maritizio's 
Shock/Horror BFC were awarded a penalty from an apparent push in back 
challenged from a throw-in.  With only 2 minutes or so approximately left 
to play this was converted with ease to the elation of the BFC team. From 
the kickoff Maritizio's continued endeavor won them a corner with literally 
1 minute on the clock left. BFC failed to deal with the corner , which 
resulted in a short sharp goalmouth scramble , the ball of which finding 
itself at the feet of a Mariizio defender which was slotted home,  2 yards 
from the goal line through the hapless Keeper's legs. Maritizio went ecstatic to say 
the least and 1 minute later the game was over. BFC walked away very 
frustrated in what could only be described as a lukewarm performance 
while Maritizio achieved exactly what the needed to, and can take great 
heart form the improved all round performance of the team. A betting man 
would tell you there's yet more to come from this Maritizio team.<BR>
