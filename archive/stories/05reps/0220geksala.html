												<td><P><B>February 20th 2005 Nodai, Sala 1 v 4 geckoes</b><BR>
												As the previous days weather cancelled all of the TML fixtures, there was some doubt that the match between Sala and the Geckoes would kick off as planned. However, by 3PM the weather gave way 
												enough for the game to get underway, albeit still with light rain and, at times, strong winds. Neither team was at full strength and only a few frantic phone calls in the morning ensured the 
												Geckoes would have 12 for kick off. <BR><BR>
												The Geckoes got off to the brighter start, putting Sala under heavy pressure with no early result. Sala though, to their credit, battling the entire match, fought back and created a chance 
												coming forward midway through the first half which ended up with the Geckoes keeper, Rob Keyworth claming well after a goal mouth scramble. <BR>
												The Geckoes continued pressure finally paid off when an excellent ball from Mikkel Troren played Kazu Kikuchi through and he finished coolly from just a few yards out. <BR><BR>
												Halftime 1-0 to the blues. <BR><BR>
												Sala picked up the pace in at the start of the 2nd half and put on more pressure in the first 10min than they did during most of the first half. The Geckoes were able to soak up the pressure 
												thanks to some stout defending and were awarded a plenty midway through the half as Robert Hughes was brought down just inside the box. <BR>
												After some gamesmanship from the Sala 'keeper (although he may have had a point) regarding the distance of plenty spot from the goal, Rob picked himself up and calmly slotted home the kick, 2-0. <BR>
												The Geckoes first converted PK of the year, a shameful 1-5 this year! <BR><BR>
												Shortly after Sala were granted a lifeline as a bad bounce saw a Geckoes player handle the ball inside the box, and Paul Clarke, equally calmly slotted home the plenty. The Geckoes keeper/manager, 
												Rob, went on to say later that he knew beforehand which way the Sala center back would be placing his kick which doesn't shed much light on why he inexplicably dove the other direction. 2-1. <BR>
												The Geckoes' confidence didn't suffer as they pushed the play and were rewarded after a nice move that started down the right with newcomer Tony DiCristo crossing to the far post, Kazu scooped 
												the ball up and knocked it back across goal to an unmarked Mikkel who headed in the Geckoes third. <BR><BR>
												Kazu, a strong candidate for man of the match, left the result in little doubt when he broke away and, holding off a challenge from the Sala defender, finished very well. Sala didn't hang their 
												heads and hit the post on strong drive from their striker, the ball bounced out and, very fortunately for the Geckoes, right into the grateful arms of the 'keeper. <BR><BR>
												The game was competitive, fair, and never got out of hand thanks in no small part to the expert officiating that makes the previous league we all remember so well, seem like a distant 
												memory/nightmare.<BR>
