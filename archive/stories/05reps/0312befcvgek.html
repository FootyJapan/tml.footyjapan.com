												<td><P><b>Sun March 13th 2005.OiFuto</b>The game between the Geckoes and the British Embassy got under way as scheduled, Saturday night at 6PM, 3/12, under the lights at Oi 
				Dani. The Geckoes were looking for revenge for an earlier loss a few months ago.<BR>
				However, the Embassy started brighter of the two teams and were ahead after just a few minutes as the Embassy's best player and candidate for man-of-the-match, Hitoshi 
				Matsushima broke down the left wing and put a perfect cross into the box which the BEFC newcomer, Michael Crossley headed in giving the Geckoes keeper no chance. That was 
				the wake up call for the Geckoes who increased the pressure and would have been equal on ten minutes as a sure goal was kept out by the Embassy's defender, Warren Daley's 
				hand.<BR>
				It turned out to by a terrible blow for the Embassy as Daley was given his marching orders by the Japanese referee (who was outstanding) and the other strong candidate for 
				man-of-the-match, Rob Hughes, slotted in the equalizer calmly from the spot. The Embassy, now down to ten men, didn't get down on their luck and were almost ahead again 
				shortly after the Geckoes penalty, Matsushima took a volley extremely well and was denied only just by a fine save by the Geckoes keeper Rob Keyworth, who had he trimmed 
				his fingertips that morning probably wouldn't have pushed the ball on to the post and away to safety. But once again, poor defending in the form of a poor clearance and 
				poor tackling, let Matsushima in again and he finished very well hitting the side netting, 2-1 to Embassy. <BR>
				The Geckoes continued to put on pressure but BEFC held until halftime. After the half, the Geckoes increased the pace and the Embassy's minds were still in the dressing 
				room when straight from the kick off the Geckoes attacked down the right side and a good move from players who have been in top form lately, Mikel Troen put Simon Bromwell 
				in, and he proceed to produce a fine cross to the far post tapped in, easily by Hughes. The Geckoes didn't let off the gas and were ahead shortly after the goal as Gino 
				Dilbero finished well on the volley from 12 yard out. A fourth looked on the cards and duly came from a set piece, Bromwell knocked in a superb ball for Rob H. to complete 
				his hat trick with an excellent header inside the box. The Embassy never hung their heads and always looked a threat especially through Matsushima, who did pull one back 
				from a well taken corner, however the Geckoes will ask questions as their defence left the striker completely unmarked. The last 10 minutes of the contest were tense as 
				the Geckoes, needing the win, battled hard and played mostly in the Embassy's half and did indeed hold on to secure the full three points.<BR>
				However, hats off to the Embassy who will take something from their excellent play and fight going down to 10 men so early in the match.
