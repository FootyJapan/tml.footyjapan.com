														<h2>ANOTHER FRENCH LESSON FOR SALA.</h2>
												</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><P><b>Sat 28th May,</b> Two nil up and cruising to a straightforward win over France, Sala 
 pushed the self-destruct button in the last two minutes and felt 
 like the losing team coming off the pitch.<BR><BR>
 The French started the brighter of the two teams and had a few long 
 range efforts to test the new Sala keeper, Ivan. Sala's forward line 
 had trouble with the French offside trap and would continue to do so 
 all game. This brought a little frustration to the early stages, 
 which was a lot scrappier than previous encounters between these 
 teams have been this season.<BR><BR>
 After about twenty minutes though, Dhugal finally found his bearings 
 and scampered off after a through ball, rounding the keeper, and 
 taking a perennial ice age, slotted it past the chasing defender, 
 1v0.<BR><BR>
 That was about all the action in the first half. (Apart from the 
 incident of the unreturned ball!)
 Second half found Sala firmly in control and starting to play some 
 nice passing football on a surface which, if not ideal, is at least 
 flat.<BR><BR>
 Brookey and Scotty were working hard in the middle, and Toby and 
 Dhugal were again only inches away from breaking the offside trap on 
 several occasions.  Yoshiki, returning to the starting line up after 
 an extended hiatus, showed us what weve been missing and connected 
 well with Lenny on several occasions down the left.
 It was from the right however that the second goal came, a pinpoint 
 deep cross from Toby found Lenny unmarked in a late run to the far 
 post and his cushioned volley threaded the eye of the needle between 
 the posts from a tight angle(Where does the comma go in all that?)
 2v0<BR><BR>
 Sala began playing even better from then on, but should have been 
 aware that the game wasnt over when Frances midfield maestro cracked 
 the underside of the bar from long range.
 Of course the lesson wasnt learned.
 Possesion was lost on the edge of the box (yours truly) and Frances 
 English hitman took advantage of a melee to slam home a shot into 
 the roof of the net. 2v1.<BR><BR>
 With less than a minute left, it seemed that France had left it too 
 late, but they poured forward again. Another scrappy clearance led 
 to more French possesion and when the ball came in from the right, 
 an unmarked French player headed toward goal.  Another french player 
 got a second touch on it from the six yard box and redirected it 
 past the defenders on the line. 2v2<BR><BR>
 Another crushing disappointment for Sala, who need to either learn 
 how to finish chances and kill games, or how to defend under 
 pressure. This one should have been sleeping like a baby after 
 65minutes.
