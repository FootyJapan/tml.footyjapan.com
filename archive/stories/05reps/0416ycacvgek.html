												<td><P><b>Damo's Diary. April 16th. Saturday</b> <BR><BR>7.04AM
<BR>Thought I might have to sneak out this morning as we're on an all day trip to Ina but "Her in Doors" seems relaxed about it, even pushing me off a bit earlier than necessary
<BR>7.07AM
<BR>Strange, the plumber is waiting outside. He was here during the week. Must be quite a lot of pipe he has to lay. Still, the kids like him. The eldest even called him "Dad"…..aahhh!
<BR>7.10AM
<BR>Boots-check, shin pads-check, sunglasses-check, brylcream-check, sarnies-check, 17 pages of possible routes from Yamate to Ina-check, passport-check
<BR>8.00AM
<BR>Slow journey. Boss says I have to get off to check any parks on the way. Daisuke sleeps in the park on Friday nights, apparently. Must be some sort of Japanese pre game thing
<BR>8.30AM
<BR>Wake with a start staring at something on me that I haven't noticed before…panic over, lady next to me says it's my right foot
<BR>8.45AM
<BR>Pull into Omiya. Meet James….thought it was Daisuke that spent the night on a park bench? Excitement mounts. James says we are short…I might get a start. Slap on more brylcream and throw away the 4th McMuffin, just in case
<BR>9.15AM. 
<BR>Great excitement. Station Master leads a procession through the concourse; crowds follow…what is occurring? It's the Boss with the rest of the boys in tow! He's had to take all his gear out of his bag again, just so everybody gets to carry a bit. Nothing left for me, though. That's not a good sign
<BR>9.16AM
<BR>Have to rush to the toilet, Boss says I'm in!! We only have 10 and the Station Master has a bad leg. In fact it has been recently amputated above the knee. He refuses to go in goal even so there's nothing left for it, I start!
<BR>9.20AM
<BR>My heart skips a beat when the Boss confides in me that I am not, after all, the biggest tosser in Yokohama. That accolade is now passed collectively to the 5 other Yokohama based team members who couldn't be bothered to make the journey to Ina for the Cup QF
<BR>9.25AM. 
<BR>This day gets better and better. We get to ride from Omiya to Hanuki on Noddy's train. I'm in heaven…until the Boss clips me and says he's going to go back and get 1 of the McDonalds girls… the fat one….to play instead of me if I don't get my thumb out of my mouth
<BR>10.15AM
<BR>The Magnificent 10 get to Hanuki in plenty of time for the 11.30 KO. Unfortunately there's not a bus until 11.27. The very nice boys from Geckoes aren't fazed, though, and organize taxis for everybody


<BR>11.30AM
<BR>We're off and up to 11 as 1 rather reluctant KGFC guy agrees to play his 2nd game of the morning
<BR>11.40AM
<BR>We are under the cosh a bit and Daisuke has definitely spent the night in the park. Instead the Boss has to rely on me and I must have messed up cos they score. A cheeky chip over our heads and the CF, Kazu, slips the ball under the advancing Gary. We don't know who to blame as neither of us was anywhere near the guy when he scored. We can't blame Gary as he's a Geordie and you know what happens when they get into a row on the pitch. Daisuke gets the blame as he's fast asleep by now and can't argue back
<BR>11.50AM
<BR>I'm really getting into it with Kazu the ref. I'm so mad I'm dribbling down my chin. Kazu couldn't give a toss. He says he's got 5 kids at home so he's used to it
<BR>11.51AM
<BR>My chance to star. Free kick outside their box and I take it quickly before Joe or Phil can get there. Direct pot goes up and over their wall, beats the goalie but it cannons back off the bar. Boss is apoplectic. "Aim lower, you knob-end!"
<BR>12.05PM
<BR>We're still discussing my inadequacy when there's some excitement at the other end. The ball is pinging around the WSG goal line with just about everybody flinging themselves at the ball. The commotion wakes Daisuke and the 3 of us are just moving forward to take a closer look when Kazu, the ref, gives us a goal. The keeper cries foul, we claim it's crossed the line 3 times and both sides appeal for handballs
<BR>12.08PM
<BR>Kazu, the Ref, signals goal and its 1-1
<BR>12.10PM
<BR>The Geckoes linesman raises his flag just as we were about to restart. Kazu asks him, "was the goal a foul, handball, obstruction or didn't it cross the line?"  "Yes" he says so Kazu decides to blow for HT
<BR>12.30PM
<BR>We've really turned things around in the 2H and are all over them. Their Goalie keeps getting in the way of all our shots though which is starting to irritate the Boss. He sends me up for another free kick telling me not to come back if I can't do a simple thing like get it underneath the crossbar and around the goalie
<BR>12.31PM
<BR>"Under the bar, round the goalie.  Under the bar, round the goalie" I repeat it 20 times as I run forward. Even then I almost screw up. I keep it down but the Goalie dives and gets a hand to it. Luckily it's going too fast for him and it flies in. 2-1
<BR>12.40PM
<BR>We're well on top but can't kill them off. Kazu, the Gecko, is really starting to tick me off so I take a run at him and shove him in the chest with both hands as hard as I can. He doesn't move 1 inch and I think I've sprained my wrist
<BR>12.41PM
<BR>Forgive Kazu, the Gecko, but he knows not to mess with me again
<BR>12.49PM
<BR>Unbelievable! They score. Tony Hopwood passes them the ball and Simon lashes it straight in past Gary.2-2. The Boss just glares at Tony. Tony phones his wife and tells her to stock up with pureed food and straws
<BR>12.50PM
<BR>Spot Joe haring forward through an extremely tired Geckoes defence. Put a 40 yard pass right into his stride and a finishes 1st time like a champion. 3-2
<BR>12.51PM
<BR>Boss gives Tony the chance to redeem himself and lets himself get beaten in the air. Tony bravely heads clear in the 6 yard box and stocks of straws and pureed foods plummet in NY trading
<BR>12.52PM
<BR>Stocks rebound as Luigi gets into it with their right winger. Somebody whispers "Mafia" in his ear, though and the Gecko makes a point of kissing Luigi's ring (no,  the one on his finger, actually)
<BR>12.53PM
<BR>Get another free kick in exactly the same place. Everybody knows what's coming and this one I get exactly right. Under the bar and around the goalie. 4-2 and even the Geckoes look relieved that there won't be extra time
<BR>12.55PM
<BR>Kazu, the Ref, blows and we can all go home ASAP to the wives
<BR>2.00PM
<BR>Forgot about the stupid bus 
<BR>2.30PM
<BR>All happy on Noddy's toy train on the way home. Daisuke is saying that he's amazed by the Bosses fitness. He was up and down the pitch and covered every blade of grass etc. Obviously it was Phil Denham but he had driven home so we all kept quiet
<BR>2.40PM
<BR>Far out! Pass over a whole siding full of green and white Noddy train carriages
<BR>3.30PM
<BR>Expected the wife to be a bit tetchy when I phoned but she said "No, don't rush home, Dear. The plumber is still at it" She seemed pretty insistent to be honest
<BR>3.45PM
<BR>Boss calls for an urgent debriefing in the Hobgoblin at Shibuya station. Very tempted, especially as Daisuke is going and I know that it makes me look good just standing doing nothing between the Boss and Daisuke.
<BR>4.00PM
<BR>Decide instead to sneak back for another ride on the train to Hanuki and happily suck my thumb dreaming of the days glories. Hope to get a start in the semi, but heard the Boss was trying to get the Hanuki Station Master to reconsider
