												<td><P><B>January 30th 2005 Oifuto Dirt, Sala 4 v 0 Maritizio</b><BR>
												Shaking off their sleepyheads, proved more of a problem for Sala than one might have imagined, as they underwhelmed ten man Maritizio, for the first period of the 
												game, before putting on a smoother performance for the rest of the game to run out four goal winners.<BR>
												A 9'o'clock start was always a tall order in darkest January, but the weather turned out to be clement. Sunny with a breeze and clear blue skies, the only problems 
												being the glare from the low sun, and the pitch.<BR>
												Oifuto Dirt is never the best of pitches, but on this morning it resembled a Serengheti plain, over which the Wildebeest had just migrated.<BR>
												It should also be noted that Clarkey, despite the 9 hour time difference from last weeks game, managed to get up and play. Think about it... the guy had nine hours 
												less sleep than the week before, unheard of in these times!<BR><BR>
												Maritizio started with ten men, but immediately took a strangle hold on the match, pinning Sala back. Their rapid futsal style befuddled even the most dextrous of 
												players and left many a Sala member foolishly in their wake. <BR>
												Knowing that the eleventh man was on his way, a strong start was what the doctor ordered, and about the 15 min mark, they took command. 
												Brian G released Yoshiki down the right flank, who with Charles and Dhugal screaming for it in the middle, was selfish enough to just score himself. <BR>
												1v0 <BR>
												Mis-hit cross or Gheorge Hagi in the making? We will never know.  <BR>
												Sala knew they were lucky to be one up, and less than ten minutes later were perhaps fortunate to find themselves two up.  <BR>
												Having conceded roughly bucket loads of penalties in recent games, Sala were finally awarded one themselves, when a Maritizio defender, jumping for the ball, 
												couldn't resist showing off his Basketball skills to the big man. Clarkey exorcised some demons, having missed one in the same goal, on the same ground, against 
												the same opposition a few months ago.  He confidently stroked it to the keepers left. <BR>
												2v0  <BR>
												Sala swarmed forward at every opportunity now, with a lot of good play coming up the right hand side. Dhugal should have made it three, but somehow scooped it over, 
												Brian passed when he might have shot(though it was a nice idea) and Shigeru showed an absolute touch of class with a defence splitting ball to Jody, who also failed 
												to make it three.  <BR>
												Not long before half time however, Sala showed that perseverance is just the tonic for a goal shy front line. Dhugal beat his man on the touchline, stole into the 
												box and after a few dummy shots, slipped the ball inside the near post. It was a cool touch, showing a level of composure which was missing from the whole team for 
												most of the game(Including himself!) <BR>
												HT 3v0  <BR>
												Sala made two changes at the start of the second half and returned to face eleven men. Naoki and Giles replaced Brian and Jody.  <BR>
												The second half was a scrappy affair, with Maritizio having most of the possession and the best chances. Apart from one nice save, which had already been called for 
												offside, Andy Cross had a pretty comfortable day at the office. This should mean congratulations to the defence, and in fairness a 0 against scoreline is always a 
												good thing, but on this occasion it was left to the opposition to help us out. <BR>
												No black marks against anyone in particular ( Although there was one occasion when Clarkey was talking Swahili to Guidos Romanian, which caused a small 
												communication problem) but the tricky number 14 created many chances for his forwards who seemed to have left their shooting boots at home.  <BR>
												So as they were left inventing new ways to miss, Sala thanked their good fortune and stuck a fourth in. Shigeru and Naoki provided a good base in midfield, with 
												Giles and Lenny persistent down the flanks. It was Naoki(I think) who released the hare-like Dhugal from about the half way line, and with the greyhounds behind him, 
												he didn't fancy being on the menu. The nippy antipodean outstripped his pursuers and dinked a neat finish past the oncoming keeper. <BR>
												4v0.  <BR>
												Clarkey seemed to take this an excuse for anyone and his dog to get forward and start pinging shots, and from a cleared corner he nailed one right between the posts. 
												I haven't seen the like since Gavin Hastings slotted a beauty over from the touchline against the French in Paris in 1997.  A few minutes later, Giles, who unlike 
												Clarkey, was still playing the same code of football as the rest of us, and obviously inspired by Yoshiki's first half goal, bounced one off the top of the bar. <BR>
												Minutes later Charles appeared stricken by flidomitism in his inability to connect any part of his body with a Dhugal knock down from a Lenny corner. Shigeru and Martin 
												were replaced by Brian G and Jody about mid way through the half. This wasn't before Shigeru had split the corner flag from the penalty spot, as the pitch showed it has 
												no discrimination in talent when choosing its victims.  <BR>
												Naoki, Brian G and Giles put a lot of energy into the later stages as Sala killed the game off. Clarkey, Guido and Martin looked solid despite a couple of hiccups, and 
												Yoshiki impressed again at right back. Jody, Lenny and Shigeru gave the kinds of performances that we get used to watching week in week out, without ever really getting 
												too much praise. It shouldn't take an outstanding performance one week, to notice that somebody plays very well every week. Up front, Dhugal stuck in his third goal in 
												3 games, which isn't bad by anyones standards.  <BR>
												A much improved result, if not a totally convincing performance.  But behaviour was certainly better all round, despite playing a team who have a cunning grasp of what 
												they can and can't get away with.  <BR>
												Honorable mention: Dhugal: Two goals and an all round strong performance.<BR>
												Shigeru: Touch of class, despite not playing for a while.<BR>
												Naoki: Controlled the second half.<BR>
												Man of the Match: Yoshiki: Puts in performances like this every week. Tireless running, defence and attack, rarely beaten... and got a goal. Even came to an expensive 
												Italian restaurant after the game! Great stuff.  <BR>
