												<td><P><B>Sun January 16th 2005, OiFuto DaiNi. </B>A cold and wet day at Oifuto saw the Swiss and Sala lineup for a 4 pm kick
off.  The Swiss in white and Sala in black.  No one really wanted to be on
the pitch but recognized the importance of the match as there remained more
than half the league's matches to complete.  Sala seemed to have their full
team ready although Naoki not in the lineup is always a welcome sight.  The
Swiss fielded a slightly makeshift team with gaps in defense and midfield
but the replacements were of good quality.<BR>The first half was evenly
fought, mostly in midfield as Sala only seemed to be playing with a lone
striker.  Their defense as well was pretty deep, trying to keep Karl and Ian
under wraps.  The Swiss played it around the back but Dierk and JP found it
crowded in midfield.  A few openings for the Swiss came from overlaps on the
right and left which led to some nice crosses, one of them turned in for a
shot by Ian only to be well saved by Andy's face as he rushed out to cut
down the angle.  However, there were no clear opportunities for both sides
as the defenses were firm and sloppy passing made it harder to get through.
The first big opportunity fell to the Swiss as Angelo had created some space
and received the ball in the penalty area, he was shouldered by Paul and
collapsed in a heap,  Ricky called for a PK with Paul questioning his
sanity.  Ian stepped up but Andy's antics in goal seemed to have an affect
and it was saved with Andy diving to his right.<BR>It looked as if the Swiss
had blown the best that was going to come until about 10 minutes to go in
the half.  A Swiss corner was played in low to Graeme outside the area, he
missed his first time shot but the ball went through to Yuji who struck a
right footed shot from 25 meters out, it curled into the upper corner.   
<BR><BR>The 2H was to be more of the same although Sala did seem to show a little
more intent up front with the introduction of another striker.  It was
strange though because the normally active Giles on the left was playing
very deep and not getting involved in the attack, that allowed the Swiss
right back more freedom to push forward and threaten the Sala defenders.
This happened a couple of times and Angelo was set free for a 1-1 but tried
to cut it across to Ian.  More solid defense meant pretty stale in terms of
chances, only a hand ball in the box by one of the Sala defenders led to
another Swiss chance in the form of a PK.  Ian stepped up again and didn't
miss this one for a 2-0 Swiss lead with 20 minutes to go.<BR>The Swiss started
to lose some composure and gave the ball away to easily on clearances and
passes from midfield were not finding the forwards.  The pressure started to
tell and sure enough, Giles started the move which led to an unusual looping
shot from the tall and lanky dreadlocked midfielder with about 7 minutes to
go.  The shot was unexpected as he turned past his marker and left Peter
Pauli stranded as it floated into his right hand corner.  The last few
minutes were hectic as Sala pushed hard for an equalizer - a Sala corner
before the whistle and the ball bouncing in the area for anyone to claim it
was in the end cleared to safety by the Swiss.  A 2-1 victory to the Swiss.
Well done to both teams and we look forward to the 2H of the season.
