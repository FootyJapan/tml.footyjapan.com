												<td><P><B>Sun January 16th 2005, OiFuto DaiNi. </B>It had been raining 2 days solidly and it was bitterley cold ahead of this Sun evening fixture at Oi 
												Astro but an hour before the match, the rain stopped, the wind dropped and if it could have the sun would have shone. There was certainly a little sunshine 
												late in the match for the BaBas.<BR>
												The last time these two teams met a 3-3 draw was played out at Yokohama, BaBas feeling very unlucky not to have gotten the win with a goal ruled offside in the 
												final 2 minutes of the game. <BR><BR>
												Line up for Sun night was Fred in goal, defensive back 4 of Darren A, Fergs, Alex & John Mac, 
												5 midfielders with RC on the left, John Stokes, Nick Cederwell and Clarke in the middle, Hideyuki on the right and Denis our man up front. Starting on the 
												bench were Yusuke & Hiro.<BR>
												Given the result last time out a fairly even encounter was expected but after a couple of early glimpses the next 20 minutes were all Shane. In fairness the 
												defence and retreating midfield coped pretty well, reducing most attacks to a long range shot or a blocked cross but after 20 mins Shane got a break thru, 
												their striker looked to be held out well with one BaBa closing him down and another nearby but a speculative shot from the edge of the box went thru a tangle 
												of BaBa legs giving Fred a late view of it and Shane were 1-0 up. <BR>
												BaBas seemed to loose what little confidence they had and the next 15 minutes was more Shane attacking, a couple of scrambled efforts a couple of saves and a 
												few close calls before a Shane striker picked up the ball with acres of space in the middle of the field and charged thru on goal unchallenged, the advancing 
												Fred could do nothing to narrow the angle and a well taken goal gave Shane a 2-0 lead .<BR>
												Yusuke had been on for about 10 minutes and hadn't really got a decent ball yet but within a minute of the restart he picked up a neat pass on the right, left a 
												midfielder or two standing and from the far right cut back into the box to be met by Nick who still had work to do. Nick held the ball up, sidestepped a 
												defender and put the ball under the keeper for a quick reply and 2-1. Not a true reflection of the chances at that point in the game but BaBas were back in it. <BR>
												For the next 7 or 8 minutes till the break BaBas were a different team, passing neatly, producing some flowing football and creating a couple of chances. 
												From the restart BaBas continued as they left off and within 10 mins Nick had a great chance to level the score, the ball bounced awkwardly on the edge of 
												the box as Nick picked up the pass but he steadied himself and lobbed the advancing keeper only to see the ball narrowly clear the bar, a real let off for 
												Shane. 10 minutes later Yusuke was put clear on the edge of the box and cutting in from the right, kept his cool and slotted past the keeper to make it 2-2.<BR>
												With 20 minutes to go Shane tried to get back into the game but BaBas were containing them well and still producing a couple of half chances. As the game 
												approached the last 2 minutes, BaBas were awarded a corner. BaBas lined up in the box for Alex to deliver. A good ball in was well cleared to the half way 
												line by Shane and the danger should have been over but Fergs stepped up and punted the ball back with interest, catching the goalkeeper a few yards off his 
												line and scrambling to get a finger tip to Fergs 50 yard precision lob. Shane watched in horror as the ball thundered onto the inside of the post spinning 
												back across the goal line for an unbelievable goal and 3-2 scoreline to the BaBas. <BR>
												BaBas hung on for the last couple of mins for a great victory in their first competitive game of 2005  <BR><BR>
												Man of the Match : Fergs again, not just for the goal but it certainly helped.
