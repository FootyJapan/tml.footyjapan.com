												<td><P><B>February 12th 2005 Hachioji Park, Sala 0 v 3 Swiss</b><BR>
												The Sala express, unbeaten in three, was derailed in deepest Saitama by old foes the Swiss.  <BR>
												On a blemish free artificial surface, well suited to Sala's fluid passing style, hopes were high for a victory over a team who had just lost the league leadership.  Things did not 
												quite turn out that way however.  Mere minutes into the first half, Sala found themselves in the now customary position of being a goal down.  A Corner from the right was met by the 
												giant Swiss centre-half, captain Kirk, who glanced a header in off the far post. 0v1. <BR>
												The only positive thing that could be said was that it was the best possible time to lose a goal, and with the whole game ahead of them, Sala didn't panic.  
												There were few moments to remember in the first half asides from numerous bizarre refereeing decisions, but Sala slowly found their rhythm.  They began to spread the ball around well, 
												having the Lions share of possession.  Most of the moves came through the middle where Shigeru was dominant.  Big Steve and Clarkey kept the Swiss danger man quiet upfront and 
												although Sala created no real chances, it was clear that more was to come in the second half.  <BR><BR>
												As the lights dimmed and the gray shades of Saitama faded to black, Sala turned up the heat.  Lenny and Giles were marauding on the flanks and Brian and Shigeru patrolled the centre 
												circle to good effect.  The Swiss began to look more and more ragged taking to kicking the ball out of play when under any pressure, and as wave after wave of Sala pressure breached 
												the decks it appeared to be simply a matter of time.  <BR>
												And so it was...  <BR>
												On a rare foray upfield, the Swiss winger was set loose in the box only to be well tackled by Lenny as he was about to let fly.  The Kiwi 'veteran' timed it well and despite coming in 
												from the side appeared to take the ball cleanly before the man.  The Italian referee had other ideas though and pointed to the spot. <BR>
												 A cruel blow indeed.  Makeshift goalkeeper Brian Harlow dived well to his left to keep out the firm spot kick, but the rebound fell kindly to the Swiss forward who made amends by 
												tucking it home at the second attempt. 0v2  <BR><BR>
												Absolutely gutted, Sala threw themselves forward again.  Shigeru appeared at times to be playing in every position on the pitch, from right back to centre-forward, and everything was 
												coming through him.   Incredibly though, the game was yet to take another twist.  At about the 65 minute mark, the lippy Swiss linesman was ordered to stop adjudicating, due to his 
												verbal handbags with the ref.  In an act of consistancy Dougie was also asked to stop running the line, leaving the ref alone to judge offsides et al. <BR>
												Sala to their credit simply continued to pile on the pressure.   Charles's cross from the left was glanced just wide by Dhugal and Shigeru and Guido both came close from outside the 
												box.  The referee was beginning to lose control of the game by this point as the tackles became more ferocious. Guido found himself at the mercy of the man in black, picking up a 
												booking for politely explaining that the ref may have erred in a decision he made...  <BR>
												With minutes remaining Swiss' danger man found room on the left and slammed the ball into the top left corner for a real knock out blow to Sala.  It later became clear however that 
												he had found the room by standing several yards offside.  No linesmen, no offside, no way back for Sala, and it certainly left a bitter taste in the mouth. 0v3  <BR>
												If anyone had watched the second half and not known the score, they would probably have been shocked to find out that the team in white had been on the end of a three nil whupping, 
												such was Sala's grip on the game.  The effort and competence was set at a very high level by all involved and it was probably a good game to watch.  But at the same time the referee's 
												somewhat bizarre approach to the game certainly had an effect on the outcome.  At the end of the day though, you are always going to get dodgy penalties given against you, and dodgy 
												offside decisions even with linesmen.  What goes around comes around, and Im sure we have been on the other end of many more decisions such as these.  <BR>
												The first goal was certainly fair and when all was said and done, that would have been enough to win them the game.  A lack of goals and a lack of concentration in the opening minutes, 
												were once again the biggest problem for Sala.  Not the ref or the opposition or anything else.   But you can only believe that with the same approach to every game, there wont be too 
												many more three nil defeats in store for us.<BR>
												Honorable mention: Big Steve and Clarkey: Kept the big man quiet for the majority of the match Brian H: Certainly didn't deserve to be on the losing team. An error free game.  <BR>
												Man of the match: Shigeru: A work rate and attitude that we should all aim for.   <BR>
