	<li>Each match will be 2 halves of 40 minutes, with a 5 minute break for half-time. Often matches will be played back to back in limited time so it is imperative to keep to schedules.</li>
	<li>1st round will be groups of 4 teams, playing each other once (win=3pt, D=1pt, L=0pt) with top 2 teams (goal dif, goals scored, head to head) progressing to Knock-out round. The top 4 teams in TML Division 1 will be seeded so as they will be separated for round 1.</li>

	<li>Teams will respect the decisions made by the referees and will be expected to aid them by supplying assistants (linesmen) who are honest & fair.
