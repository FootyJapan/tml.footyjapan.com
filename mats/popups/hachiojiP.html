	<li><b>Surface:</b> Large artificial floodlit football pitch, can be used 9:00am - 9:00pm. Nice, soft surface (moulded stud ok)</li>
	<li><b>Facilities:</b> Changing rooms with hot showers, toilets &amp; &#165;100 lockers. Vending machines inside of main building for drinks.</li>
	<li><b>Parking:</b> Carpark inside complex.</li>
	<li><b>Location:</b> 10 minutes taxi from Yonohommachi Station on the JR Saikyo  <a class="txlink" href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=35.883522,139.611597&spn=0.026008,0.039954&z=15">MAP </A>for car Navi : 048-856-1313</li>
									<li><b>Rules:</b> When teams &amp; supporters leave after the match, they will make sure to clean up around the ground and changing rooms, removing all rubbish. 
	Please follow all regulations at grounds (especially smoking!).</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b class="red">WARNING - THIS APPLIES TO ALL TML TEAMS AND PLAYERS, PARTICULARLY CAPTAINS.</b><br>
									<br>
									<b class="red">The Tokyo Metropolis League has been put on PROBATION by Hachioji Park</b> - one of the best astroturf pitches we have access to,<b class="red"> for not following the rules below. From now on these rules must be adhered to or WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THIS GROUND - CAPTAINS WILL BE EXPECTED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR TEAM WHEN AT HACHIOJI PARK -  IF TML LOSES THIS GROUND THE OFFENDING TEAM(S) WILL BE HARSHLY DEALT WITH &amp; COULD FACE POSSIBLE  (read: probable) EXPULSION FROM THE LEAGUE.</b><br>
									<br>
									1) Teams are not allowed onto the playing field until 10-minutes before kick-off time - this means waiting in the changing room, or the car park (<b>NOT ON THE SIDELINES OF EITHER PITCH</b>).<br>
									<br>
									2) All rubbish must be cleared up after your game - don't leave it to someone else. Bringing along a spare plastic bag for this purpose is hardly rocket science...<br>
									<br>
									3) Outdoor shoes/boots should be removed before entering the changing room - &amp; it is important that the changing room and showers are left dirt and rubbish free.<br>
									<br>
									(*points 2 &amp; 3 are just plain common sense and apply to <b>EVERY GROUND WE USE</b> - think about it...it's not a lot to ask for players to clean up after themselves...)<br>
									<br>
									Again, this is one of the best pitches we have access to and we have promised the staff at Hachioji Park (as well as the teams/players/individuals who very kindly book this ground on our behalf) that we will tow the line. Your cooperation here is expected. <br>
