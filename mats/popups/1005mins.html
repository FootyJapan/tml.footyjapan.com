					<li><B>Where teams stand at the moment</B><br>
					Some teams in the IFFL have been having big problems with the administration, officiating and a range of other matters recently. A number of teams do 
					not wish to re-register with the IFFL and want to join a new league. Other teams want to continue with the IFFL but also become involved in a more 
					competitive league. There are now around 14 teams that have shown a strong interest in joining the TML.</li>
					<li><B>Where the TML stands</B><br>Since the meeting in February 2003, the TML have been meeting with JFL, Tokyo FA, Kanagawa FA, Tocho and other 
					organization trying to secure grounds with little success.  <br>
					Starting from June, some teams helped with the registration at Oi-futo by giving information for chosen cards. Now BFC/TML hold 16 cards securing an 
					average of 6 grounds a month at Oi- Futo. With YC & AC also joining the league, having their own ground could help supplement extra games on top of 
					YC & AC’s own games as goes for Hibs with St. Mary’s as their home ground. <br>
					However, to fulfill all the games to be played for a league of 16 teams (or 2 x 8), more grounds are still required for regular fixtures. </li>
					<li><B>Start of the TML</B><br>
					Looking at November 2003 to kick off the TML<br>
					Run it through to June (July) 2004 then start the next season September 2004</li>
					<li><B>TML format</B><br>
					2 leagues of 6 or 8 teams, playing each other once, Division 1 Stronger teams, Division 2 Weaker teams (Split of teams to be decided by recent form 
					in other leagues)<br>
					Play off for promotion/demotion at the end of the season<br>
					1st season 2003 Nov. to 2004 June/July (play each team once)<br>
					2nd season Sep. 2004 to 2005 June/July (play each team twice)<br><br>
					<B>Comments:</B><br>
					- As we cannot start with the ideal ground situation, we should be flexible and play every team not twice but once for the 1st season.<br>
					- Initially, we shouldn’t worry too much about fixing the schedule nicely. It can gradually become what we want.<br>
					- The number of grounds we can get is still a concern.</li>
					<li><B>Match fees (Cost)</B><br>
					Match fees to be about the same as the IFFL (i.e. 10,500 – 11,000 yen).<br>
					Referee fee: 6,000 yen (A view to having a ‘team’ of refs doing back to back matches ref as ref/linesman incurring higher fees but raising quality 
					of officiating.)</li>
					<li><B>Player registration: </B><br>
					Players to register with TML receiving registration card with name and team.<br>
					Information will be required to help registration process of teams for different ground lotteries (Players must indicate if the information has 
					already used by other associations like IFFL).<br>
					Although registration will incur a fee of 1,000 yen, TML plans to get discounts from different bars, sports shops, etc. with the use of the card to 
					give value to the players as well as to raise awareness and give branding of TML to sponsors.</li>
					<li><B>Cups?</B><br>
					Winning teams only will receive cups in each league, but there will also be medals for top scorer and others.<br>
					5 aside tournaments are to be planned. (Highland games 2003 is being jointly organized by TML.)<br>
					Knockout Cups like World Motors cup are also to be planned.</li>
					<li><B>Rules </B><br>
					Rules to be laid out and agreed by all team managers.<br>
					Joint Committee to be formed. (reps from: organizer , team captains/managers, refs)</li>
					<li><B>Refs?</B><br>
					Already interested refs are: Paul K, Gordon, Verna, Kazu, Tanaka <br>
					More to be sought through participating teams.</li>
					<li><B>Sponsors?</B><br>
					Metropolis: still in negotiation<br>
					Temple Bar (main sponsor?): Want to contact players in regard to their business 
					permission will be sought from players to give out any contact details.</li>
