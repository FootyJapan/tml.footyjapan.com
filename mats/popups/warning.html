								<p>The Tokyo Metropolis League is on the verge of being <b>PERMANENTLY BLACKLISTED</b> from using Hachioji Park:</p>
								<p>&#x2022; If there's <b>one single PET bottle or can left on the field</b> after TML has finished using the ground we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>.</p>
								<p>&#x2022; If players enter the pitch or sub-pitch (including the sidelines) before the alloted time (10-mins before kick off) we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>.</p>
								<p>&#x2022; If players don't remove there shoes <b>BEFORE</b> entering the <b>'COMMUNAL AREA' </b>we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b></p>
								<p>&#x2022; What you thought was a changing room is in fact a <b>public, co-ed 'COMMUNAL AREA'.</b> When girls or children are playing, TML players are to change in the <b>SHOWER</b> area, there is to be <b>no undressing</b> in the <b>COMMUNAL AREA</b> and players <b>MAY NOT</b> get changed outside the <b>COMMUNAL AREA</b> or pitch-side. If this happens again, just once - meaning a <b>SINGLE PLAYER</b>, we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>.</p>
								<p>&#x2022; A single empty shampoo/shower gel bottle left in the showers and we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>. </p>
								<p>&#x2022; NO RUBBISH CAN BE LEFT AT HACHIOJI. WHATEVER YOU CAME WITH YOU HAVE TO LEAVE WITH - YOU CAN'T HIDE IT IN THE RECYCLING BINS, OR STICK IT IN A PLASTIC BAG AND LEAVE IT FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO CLEAN UP. ESSENTIALLY <b>THERE ARE NO RUBBISH FACILITIES AT HACHIOJI PARK</b> - WE SUGGEST ON THE WAY BACK FROM THE GROUND TO THE STATION YOU STOP AT THE NEARBY 7/11 CONVENIENCE STORE AND DISPOSE OF YOUR RUBBISH THERE. If not, we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>.</p>
								<p>&#x2022; If games don't finish EXACTLY ON TIME, we'll be kicked off <b>FOREVER</b>.</p>
								<p><font color="red">&#x2022; <b>F</b></font><b><font color="red">rom now on the last teams of the day MUST CHECK with the office before they leave that everything is in order. IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AT EVERY LAST TML GAME, WE'LL BE KICKED OFF FOREVER. </font></b></p>

								<p><b>We have received complaints from </b><a class="txlink" href="fukuda_denshi.html" target="_blank"><b>Fukuda Denshi</b></a><b> regarding the poor condition of the changing rooms after TML teams have used them; being left in a mess, with rubbish lying around. We CANNOT afford to lose this ground, so it is the responsibility of the teams to make sure the ground &amp; changing rooms are left clean and tidy after use. Also, please ensure to re-attach the yellow padding to the goalposts and return the corner flags to the store-room after your match! Offenders will be held responsible &amp; reprimanded!</b></p>
