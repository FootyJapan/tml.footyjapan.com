								Setagaya Koen, 10 minutes out of Shibuya, has a beautiful 3rd generation pitch (some of you may have played there last season). Unfortunately it is usually used for baseball so it's difficult to get for the league. It has come to our attention that from November 1st, despite having floodlights, the ground closes at 5:00pm instead of 9:00pm as it does in the summer. This is because baseballers don't like to play in the cold winter evenings &amp; they have been closing early since the days when it was a dirt ground. We have spoken to the Kuyakusho about having the ground open til 9:00pm during these winter months as us footballers would be happy to use it, but of course getting this done could take a while as it must go though committees that will take time to process the request. What could speed up the process is if they get lots of requests through the 'opinion' page of their website. If you cannot read &amp; write Japanese, please could you ask your spouse, girlfriend, co-worker to fill in the form (in JAPANESE ONLY) <a href="https://www2.city.setagaya.tokyo.jp/goiken/iken_kumin_csv.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> requesting that the ground be made available in the evenings from November. This could help us secure a much needed ground in a very good location.

						<h3><font color="white">=====TML SPONSORS - Discounts at Pubs - VERY IMPORTANT==========</font></h3>
						<p><font color="white">It has been brought to our attention that some TML members are abusing the system for getting discounts at Hobgoblin and other TML sponsor pubs. If the abuse continues, we may lose our Pub sponsors, then it will be YOU the players who lose out!!<br>
								Please make sure that you SHOW YOUR CURRENT TML CARD, BEFORE asking for your bill and if you are with a group of players, ALL PLAYERS should show their cards! This discount offer is exclusive to TML MEMBERS ONLY and excuses of 'I don't have my card with me' won't work! Some of you are still using last seasons card, this will be OK til the end of September, by which time your captain will have your new card for you, then please start using that! If you have friends who wish to become a member (supporters are quite welcome to join) we just need a digital photo, their email address and &yen;2000.<br>
								<b>Pubs currently offering TML discounts: Hobgoblin, Lege nds, What the Dickens, Town Cryer, Lime/Tokyo Sports Cafe, Footnik, The Tipplers Arms, King George-Omiya</b></font></p>
